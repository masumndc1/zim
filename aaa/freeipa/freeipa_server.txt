... to install freeipa server we need some prerequisite things like below
... one fully qualified domain name which we can have free from freenom

[root@kube-node1 ~]# cat /etc/hosts | grep ipa
#127.0.0.1  ipa	ipa.masum.com
192.168.10.137  ipa	ipa.example.com
[root@kube-node1 ~]#

... starting firewalld

[root@kube-node1 ~]# systemctl start firewalld
[root@kube-node1 ~]#

... adding port to firewall

[root@kube-node1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80/tcp,443/tcp,
389/tcp,636/tcp,88/tcp,464/tcp,53/tcp,88/udp,464/udp,53/udp,123/udp}
success
[root@kube-node1 ~]#

... reloading the firewalld

[root@kube-node1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@kube-node1 ~]#

... installing bind-utils

[root@kube-node1 ~]# yum install bind-utils

... install random number generator for FreeIPA to preform the cryptographic 
... functions it needs for authentication.

[root@kube-node1 ~]# yum install -y rng-tools
[root@kube-node1 ~]# systemctl start rngd

... now installing freeipa-server

[root@kube-node1 ~]# yum install -y ipa-server

... ipa related commands we have after installing ipa-server
