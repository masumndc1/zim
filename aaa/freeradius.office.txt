__login-time attribute:__
user file configuration.
 Login-Time defines the time span a user may login to the system. The
  format of a so-called time string is like the format used by UUCP.
  A time string may be a list of simple time strings separated by "|" or ",".

  Each simple time string must begin with a day definition. That can be just
  one day, multiple days, or a range of days separated by a hyphen. A
  day is Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa or Su, or Wk for Mo-Fr. "Any" or "Al"
  means all days.

  After that a range of hours follows in hhmm-hhmm format.

  For example, "Wk2305-0855,Sa,Su2305-1655".

  Radiusd calculates the number of seconds left in the time span, and
  sets the Session-Timeout to that number of seconds. So if someones
  Login-Time is "Al0800-1800" and she logs in at 17:30, Session-Timeout
  is set to 1800 seconds so that she is kicked off at 18:00.

How do I use Login-Time for groups, not for users?

Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm for Unix group "daysonly"

DEFAULT Group == "daysonly", Login-Time := "0800-2000"
or

DEFAULT Group == "daysonly", Login-Time := "Any0800-2000"
Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm, from Monday to Friday for Unix group "weekdays"

DEFAULT Group == "weekdays", Login-Time := "Wk0800-2000"
Limit logons between 08:00am and 08:00pm, in Saturday and Sunday for Unix group "weekends"

DEFAULT Group == "weekends", Login-Time := "Sa-Su0800-2000"
