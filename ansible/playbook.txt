... playbook in ansible is written in yaml syntax.
...
... a playbook consists of three sections. 
... 
... target sections: describe the target hosts here. ssh parameters here.
... variable sections: variable to playbooks are defines in this sections.
... task sections: modules for particular tasks are define here.
...

... we are dealing with a simple playbook below.
... line spacing and the syntax should be strictly 
... followed in the yaml syntax.
