	<h1>BGP</h1>
	BGP or border gateway protocol is not must for enterprise network to connect itself to internet often used to learn, advertise and choose the
	best path selection into global internet way. this is normal for ISPs to uses bgp to share their network connectivity.

<h2>foundation topics</h2>

<h3>reserved IPv4 space</h3>
<ul>
	<li>0.0.0.0/8: self indentification on a local subnet</li>
	<li>127.0.0.0/8: loopback testing</li>
	<li>169.254.0.0/16: this is used when DHCP fails</li>
	<li>192.0.2.0/24: for documentation and example code</li>
	<li>192.88.99.0/24: used for ipv6 to ipv4 relay</li>
	<li>198.18.0.0/15: Benchmark testing for internet device</li>
</ul>

<h2>BGP basics</h2>
though the protocols used by BGP are much more different from those used by IGP but they have some similarities like below.
<ul>
	<li>bgp advertise ip4 prefix with it routing update and also establishes the peer with other router before
	so that best path selection can be made
	within numerous possible route.</li>
	<li>bgp does not need its neighbour should be placed in the same subnet which can be place in another subnet. bgp routers use tcp (port 179)
	to send bgp messages to its neighbour which may be placed in different subnet which is more common.its neighbour can be placed several
	router away.neighbour ip address is explicitely configured.</li>
	<li>bgp also send prefix/length like IGP but this is called Network layer Reachability Information(NLRI)</li>
	<li>igp advertises metric info wherease bgp uses variety of path attributes(PA) instead of metric to choose the best path selection</li>
	<li>fast scalibility which is main theme of bgp, fast convergence is for igp</li>
	<li>path vector logic similar to distance vector is used</li>
</ul>

<h2>BGP ASN and the AS_SEQ path attribute</h2>
there are plenty of Path attributes(PA) used by BGP for various purpose. if there is no pa is used explicitely then bgp uses AS_PATH (autonomous
system path) to choose the best path. one of sub components of as_path is AS_Seq(AS sequence). a route with shortest as_path is choosen.
another things to keep in mind is when a router receive a packet which inclued a ASN of its own the router then ignore that packet to avoid
looping occured.

<h2>internal and external BGP</h2>
a bgp router can have two types of peers. internal bgp(iBGP) and external BGP(eBGP). the former has peers within the same asn while later has peers
on another ASN. this two types of peer have some differences, one of many is as_path inclusion on route update done by ebgp peers while as_path
inclusion is not included with ibgp updates.

<h2>private and public ASN</h2>
<ul>
	<li>0: reserved</li>
	<li>1-64495: assigned by IANA for public use</li>
	<li>64496-65511: reserved for only documentation</li>
	<li>64512-65534: private use</li>
	<li>65535: reserved</li>
</ul>
an AS can use private ASN if the AS has only one connection to other AS as there is no possibility of occuring loops.

<h2>outbound routing toward internet comparing default route and BGP</h2>
two options to connect to internet for enterprise can be default routing and BGP.we can configure BGP when we have two connections toward internet
and we want to influence packets to choose path over another one based on some criteria or next hop availability.

<h2>dual home</h2>
this sort of connectivity has two link toward same isp. this may be two links or two router.dual home provides
<ul>
	<li>choice over one link to others and makes other link as redundant</li>
	<li>consider two links equal and load balance them and one link can be redundant if other downs</li>
</ul>
say we have two router with link of 100Mbps and 10Mbps respectively towar internet. and we also like to direct our packets alway on 100mbps over 10mbps
and also like other routers as well as 10mpbps gateway router send their traffic to 100mbps router we configure by the following.

<pre>
<h4>this one with 100mbps speed</h4>
! Configuration on router E1 - note that the configuration uses
! a hostname instead of I1-1s IP address
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 I1-1
router eigrp 1
redistribute static metric 100000 1 255 1 1500


<h4>this one with 10mbps speed</h4>
! Configuration on router E1 - note that the configuration uses
! Configuration on router E2 - note that the configuration uses
! a hostname instead of I2-1s IP address
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 I2-1
router eigrp 1
redistribute static metric 10000 100000 255 1 1500
</pre>
we must set lower value in delay in our prefered router than the other router.

<h2>choosing one path over other using BGP</h2>
this big beuty of using BGP is to choose link for a perticular destination. the engineers of enterprise must discuss with isp to choose carefully
PA as well as additional attributes to choose the destination additional with running ibgp on several router inside enterprise network.

<h2>partiall and full update BGP</h2>
BGP router with its routing table needs RAM and processors to deal with it and this routing table has huge entries and as several other routers
need to behave as iBGP pair they also need ram and processor and exhanging routing information consumes the bandwidth too.
to deal with this high memory problems we can choose one of following three tacks can be followed and isp can give me three options.
<ul>
	<li>only default routes: isp can give me only the default routes associated with BGP no others routes</li>
	<li>full update: isp sends me the entire bgp tables</li>
	<li>partial updates: isp send us the partial bgp tables which may be required to pass through their traffic along with a defaul route.</li>
</ul>
among the three some commented partial along with default is better than single default route. in that situation BGP will use that partial table for
known route and use default route for unknown destination.


<h2>single multi homed</h2>
this means enter prise has multiple links towards mulitple isps but this may with a single link or multi link toward each isp. this also can be
from a single route or multiple router from enterprise.

<h2>dual multihome</h2>
this is like single multihomed where two or more isp has connection with enterprise but this time each router has multiple link towards isp.
