.. spanning tree protocol, stp send bridge protocol data unit, BPDU
.. to know the other switch status in well known stp broadcast 
.. mac address as destination. 01-80-c2-00-00-00. bpdu messages send
.. in every 2 seconds. 

.. there are two types of bpdu exists 
.. a. configuration bpdu: use for spanning tree computation
.. b. topology change notification, TCN bpdu: this is used when topology changes.

.. the switch ports are remain in three states in stp operation

.. disable: disable by system administrator or system for any fault condition

.. blocking: this is the begining state in a stp operation. blocking state port
.. cant send or receive the data. it can only receive the bpdu. ports which
.. put into stanby mode to avoid looping enter into blocking mode.

.. listening: when port is in listening mode it allows to sending and
.. receiving of bpdu but not allowed to transmit the data frame. 

.. learning: after some forwarding delay time port enter to learning state
.. where it can still send and receive the bpdu but cant take parts in sending
.. data.

.. forwarding: this is the fully functional state of a port enter after
.. another forwarding delay in listening state. and in this state a port
.. can transmit and receive both bpdu and data frame. 

.. we can see the state of the port like below

R1#show spanning-tree interface fastEthernet 1/1
 Port 42 (FastEthernet1/1) of VLAN1 is forwarding
   Port path cost 19, Port priority 128, Port Identifier 128.42.
   Designated root has priority 32768, address c200.1c2a.0000
   Designated bridge has priority 32768, address c200.1c2a.0000
   Designated port id is 128.42, designated path cost 0
   Timers: message age 0, forward delay 0, hold 0
   Number of transitions to forwarding state: 1
   BPDU: sent 4736, received 1

.. this port is in forwarding state.

.. timing in stp operation.

.. hello time: default 2seconds is the hello time for the root bridge to send 
.. the tcn bpdu. also each switch also has its own hello times to retransmit
.. tcn bpdu to neighbour switch which it has received from other.

.. forward delay: time lapse between listening and learning state of a port
.. default is 15 sec.

.. max age: it is the maximum time for a switch to hold bpdu received from
.. other switches. default is 20 seconds.

.. when change occurs switches send the TCN BPDUs to its root port. also 
.. note that this file does not contains any data but just inform that a
.. change has been occured. interestingly a switch will not send any tcn bpdu
.. if the port has been configured as portfast. what happens when a switching
.. port is configured as portfast it puts into directly forwarding state
.. when the port comes back. 

... common spanning tree (CST) 
.. single spanning tree running for multiple vlan is called the cst. it has 
.. some advantages like cpu reduction as well as disadvantages like it can
.. block redundant link for load balancing. moreover link which is not carrying
.. any specific vlan traffic can be put into forward mode where other link
.. which carries vlans can be blocked.

.. per vlan spanning tree (PVST) is the cisco proprietary which has enhanced
.. cst operation. running individual stp for each vlan will give more control
.. over redundant link. like one link on one vlan and other link on different
.. and both of them running separate stp and both of them forwarding. this 
.. requires operation between two cisco switches as this is cisco proprietary
.. and cisco inter switch link (ISL) encapsulation trunking protocol.
.. operations between cst and pvst fails because of intercompability.

.. per vlan spanning tree plus (PVST+) has capability to incorporates between
.. cst and pvst made by cisco. features like

.. cst: running 1 instance of stp over trunk link. 802.1Q based
.. pvst: running multiple instance of stp for different vlans. cisco isl based.
.. pvst+: intercompatibility between cst and pvst.operates over both isl and
.. 802.1Q.
