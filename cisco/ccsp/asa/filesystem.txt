#### filesystem ###

asa comes with default storage like flash: and disk0: which is actually same
thing in terms of filesystem.

when a user connect to asa its session start with disk0:/root

asa also support disk1: which is removable flash memory.


# working with filesystem.

to create a directory in a filesystem, mkdir is used with /noconfirm
to instruct asa not to give notification as by default it notices user
every time before creating or deleting any file and directory.


asa(config)# mkdir /noconfirm flash:/masum
Created dir flash:/masum

asa(config)# dir /recursive
Directory of flash:/*
Directory of flash:/masum
No files in directory
16128000 bytes total (16122368 bytes free)

asa(config)# dir flash:
Directory of flash:/

16128000 bytes total (16122368 bytes free)

asa(config)# dir system:
Directory of system:/

asa(config)#


##### viewing the content of the file with "more" command ####

we use "more" command to view the content of a file like below.

asa(config)# more system:/running-config

--<output cut>--

we can also use "copy, rename, delete" command to files.

####### using new image rather than the default one ####

we can instruct asa to load another image in next boot by
"boot system <url>" command. and we have to save the instruction
to the startup-config file by "copy running-config startup-config"
and reload the asa with the command "reload". we can see the change
with "show bootvar" command.


asa(config)# reload ?

exec mode commands/options:
  at             Reload at a specific time/date
  cancel         Cancel a scheduled reload
  in             Reload after a time interval
  max-hold-time  Maximum hold time for orderly reload
  noconfirm      Reload without asking for confirmation
  quick          Quick reload without properly shutting down each subsystem
  reason         Reason for reload
  save-config    Save configuration before reload
  <cr>
asa(config)# reload at ?

exec mode commands/options:
  hh:mm  Time to reload (hh:mm)
asa(config)# reload at

#### fsck command

fsck command to check filesystem error. by default at every boot
asa performs the filesystem check therefore no need to check manually
often. if any error found then asa will create fsckxxxx.ren file where
xxxx starts with 0000. an example can be below.


ciscoasa(config)# fsck flash:

Fsck operation may take a while. Continue? [confirm]

flashfs[7]: 7 files, 3 directories

flashfs[7]: Total bytes: 16128000

ciscoasa(config)# dir
