.. we first configure an access-list then we place it to outside interface
.. inbound direction. reason of inbound direction is asa permit traffic
.. from higher security interface to lower security interface but not from
.. lower to higher. that why we need to place the access-list at outside
.. interface, inbound direction for when icmp echo-reply comes back to
.. outside interface and trying to enter.
