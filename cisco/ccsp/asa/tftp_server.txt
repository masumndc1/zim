sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp

Create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp

sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/tftp

and put this entry

service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
user            = nobody
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}
Create a folder /tftpboot this should match whatever you gave in server_args. mostly it will be tftpboot

sudo mkdir /tftpboot
sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot
Restart the xinetd service.

sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
You must allow udp port 69 in firewall.

also u must comment out any entry related to tftp in previously configured tftp

also verify the connectivity with 

#netstat -anu  u for udp and t for tcp
