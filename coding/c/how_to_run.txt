/* demo.c:  My first C program on a Linux */

int main(void)

 printf("Hello! This is a test prgoram.\n");
 return 0;
}

... How do I compile the program on Linux?
... Use any one of the following syntax to 
... compile the program called demo.c:
 
cc program-source-code.c -o executable-file-name

... OR
 
gcc program-source-code.c -o executable-file-name

... OR

... assuming that executable-file-name.c exists 
... make executable-file-name
... In this example, compile demo.c, enter:
 
cc     demo.c   -o demo

... OR
... assuming demo.c exists in the current directory 

make demo

... If there is no error in your code or C program then the 
... compiler will successfully create an executable file called 
... demo in the current directory, otherwise you need fix the code. 
... To verify this, type:

$ ls -l demo*

... How do I run or execute the program called demo on Linux?
... Simply type the the program name:

$ ./demo

... OR

$ /path/to/demo
