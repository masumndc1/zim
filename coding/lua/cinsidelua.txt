... prerequisite: you must have gcc, g++, lua, liblua-dev installed.
...
... my C file has the function decode_file.
... this decode_file, i want to use in my lua file.
... this example has been taken from
... https://medium.com/@imwithye/interfacing-lua-with-c-92a1067435ab
... and https://chsasank.com/lua-c-wrapping.html
... most of the credit goes to them.

... as the location of the luaxlib.h, lualib.h and lua.h are inside
... /usr/include/lua5.4 in debian, therefore header includes 
... <lua5.4/luaxlib.h>. Otherwise C will not find the headers file.

#include <lua5.4/lauxlib.h>
#include <lua5.4/lualib.h>
#include <lua5.4/lua.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// declare the function with lua state
static int decode_file(lua_State *L)
{
    printf("call decode_file from C\n");
    return 0;
}

// register the function
static const luaL_Reg lodepng[] = {
    {"decode_file", decode_file},
    {NULL, NULL},
};

// load the function as library
int luaopen_lodepng(lua_State *L)
{
    luaL_newlib(L, lodepng);
    return 1;
}

// just main function doing nothing
int main (void) {
	return 0;
}

... as I have installed lua from apt-get in a debian/ubuntu machine
... and the version of lua is 5.4, i have used -llua5.4 with my 
... gcc build. content of the Makefile. and build with make command

build:
	gcc -Wall -fPIC -llua5.4 -shared -o lodepng.so lua_lodepng.c

clean:
	rm -fr *.so

...
... after the compilation with gcc, we will have lodepng.so library file 
... which we can use as module in my lua program file.
...

$ cat practise.lua
#!/usr/local/bin/lua

local operations = require "lodepng"

-- load lodepng as my library module in my lua file.
-- from the module, load decode_file().

operations.decode_file()

# lua practise.lua
call decode_file from C
#
