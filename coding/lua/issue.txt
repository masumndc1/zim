... i was having issue with lua-cjson, I have solved it by installing
... explicitly 2.1.0-1 by
... luarocks install lua-cjson 2.1.0-1
...
... Error: Failed finding Lua header files. You may need to install
... them or configure LUA_INCDIR liinux
...
... in this case you need to install gcc
... also in ubuntu/debian you may try to install liblua5.3-dev
... you should use header file like /usr/bin/env lua-5.1, so
... it uses lua5.1 while running code.

sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev
