... ruby super keyword.
... note the code below. here, when super is called in Cat class, it
... will look for the same method "name" from its parent class, and 
... execute it.


#!/usr/bin/evn ruby

class Animal
  def name
    puts 'Animal class'
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def name
    super
  end
end

cat = Cat.new
cat.name

... output:
# "Animal class"

... we can use super() or super(arg1, arg2, .. argN) to pass its parameters.
