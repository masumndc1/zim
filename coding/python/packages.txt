... how to build packages in python
... 
... there is two approaches.
... 
... 1. with setup.py 
... you put everything in setup.py and run
... python3 setup.py build and
... python3 setup.py install

... 2. with setup.cfg and with setup.py
... instead of putting build parameters in setup.py
... you declare them in setup.cfg
... your setup.py will only have 

#!/user/bin/env python3

import setuptools

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup()

... and then run
... python3 setup.py build and
... python3 setup.py install
... alternatively you can run pip install -e package-folder

... 3. with pyproject.toml and setup.cfg and no setup.py
... you declare your build parameters in pyproject.toml 
... and in setup.cfg and then run
... "python3 -m build --sdist --wheel ."
... you need to have pypa-build which you can install by
... pip install build
... you can do all them in a single shot,
... pip install -e package_folder
...
