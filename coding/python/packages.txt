... how to build packages in python
...
... doc: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
...
... there is two approaches.
...
... 1. with setup.py
... you put everything in setup.py and run
... python3 setup.py build and
... python3 setup.py install

... 2. with setup.cfg and with setup.py
... instead of putting build parameters in setup.py
... you declare them in setup.cfg
... your setup.py will only have

#!/user/bin/env python3

import setuptools
# from setuptools import setup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setuptools.setup()
    # setup()

... and then run
... python3 setup.py build and
... python3 setup.py install
... alternatively you can run pip install -e package-folder

... 3. you need to have pypa-build which you can install by
... pip install build
... with pyproject.toml and setup.cfg and no setup.py
... you declare your build parameters in pyproject.toml
... and in setup.cfg and then run
... "python3 -m build"
... this will create two files in dist folder, whl and tar

➜  vatde git:(master) ✗ ls
LICENSE        README.md      dist           pyproject.toml setup.cfg      src
➜  vatde git:(master) ✗ ls dist
vatde-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl vatde-0.0.1.tar.gz
➜  vatde git:(master) ✗

... these two files you can ship as package to others.
... they can install this package by
... pip install -e vatde/dist/vatde-0.0.1.tar.gz
...
