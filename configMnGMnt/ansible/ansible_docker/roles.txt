... we can use ansible roles inside a container by following.
...
... the purpose of using roles is install pkg, configure
... service inside a container etc.

... also we need to remember that python should be installed
... in the target container beforehead.
... also we need docker-py installed in the docker hosts.

... first we need to configure our inventory file like below.

... cat /etc/ansible/hosts
masumtst        ansible_connection=docker ansible_python_interpreter=python

... then we will create a roles by ansible-galaxy

ansible-galaxy init --init-path=./ test

... cd /root/ansible/test

... we will put required files in according place.
...
... now will make a playbook and add that role with target container.
...
... example ansible playbook is below.


       ▶  $ cat test.yaml
       ---
       - hosts: localhost
         tasks:
           - name: running container
             docker_container:
               name: masumtst
               image: masumpy:latest
               state: started
               command: sleep infinity
           #   command: ["sleep", "1d"]
               ports:
                 - 8080:80

        - hosts: masumtst
          roles:
            - test

... and the mail.yaml file in tasks is

        ▶  $ cat test/tasks/main.yml
        ---
        # tasks file for test
        - apt:
            name: vim
                state: present


... and finally when we run the ansible-playbook test.yaml, we have found
... an running container named masumtst. and the ansible will also install
... required packages in instructed in the ansible role.
