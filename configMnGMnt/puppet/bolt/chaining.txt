- require is possible to make chain like following

package { ['python3']:
  ensure => installed,
}

package{ ['ansible']
  ensure => installed,
  require => Package['python3']
}

- another way, the same in plan

package { ['python3']:
  ensure => installed,
}

package{ ['ansible']
  ensure => installed,
  require => Package['python3']
}

Package['python3'] -> Package['ansible']

- another way

package { ['python3']:
  ensure => installed,
} ->  package{ ['ansible']
  ensure => installed,
}
