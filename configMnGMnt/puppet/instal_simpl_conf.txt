... puppet installation and configuration

... Puppet is an automation tool which allows you to automate the configuration
... of software like apache and nginx across multiple servers.

... Puppet installation:

... In this tutorial we will be installing Puppet in the Puppet/Agent mode.
... You can install it in a Stand Alone mode as well.

... Puppet server configuration

[user@puppet ~]# sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-6.noarch.rpm
[user@puppet ~]# sudo yum install puppet-server

... Add your puppet server hostnames to the conf file under the [main] section

[user@puppet ~]# sudo vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
 dns_alt_names = puppet,puppet.yourserver.com
[user@puppet ~]# sudo  service puppetmaster start 

... Puppet listens on port no 8140, ensure to unblock it in CSF or your firewall.



... Puppet client configuration

[user@client ~]# sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-6.noarch.rpm
[user@client ~]# sudo yum install puppet

[user@client ~]#sudo vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

...The puppetmaster server

[main]
server=puppet.yourserver.com

... now start the puppet

[root@masum init.d]# service puppet status
puppet (pid  1618) is running...
[root@masum init.d]# service puppet restart
Stopping puppet agent:                                     [  OK  ]
Starting puppet agent:                                     [  OK  ]
[root@masum init.d]# 

... Puppet uses SSL to communicate with it’s clients, when you start 
... puppet on a client, it will automatically connect to the puppet 
... server in it’s conf file and request for it’s certificate to be signed.

... On the puppet server run

[user@puppet ~]# sudo  puppet cert list
vps.client.com (FD:E7:41:C9:2C:B7:5C:27:11:0C:8F:9C:1D:F6:F9:46)

[user@puppet ~]# sudo  puppet cert sign vps.client.com
notice: Signed certificate request for vps.client.com


.....Installing apache web server with puppet

... Although puppet server configuration is stored in “/etc/puppet/puppet.conf”,
... client configurations are stored in files called manifests.

... On the puppet server run

[user@puppet ~]# sudo vim /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

node ‘vps.client.com’ {
     package { ‘httpd’ :
     ensure => installed,
     }
}

... The configuration is pretty self explanatory, the first 
... line indicates that we need to install this configuration on 
... a client machine with the hostname ‘vps.client.com’. If you want to 
... apply the configuration to the puppet server then replace ‘vps.client.com’ 
... with ‘default’. Read node definitions for multiple node configurations.

... The next two lines tell puppet that we need to ensure that the apache web 
... server is installed. Puppet will check if apache is installed and if not, install it.

... Think of a “package” as an object, “httpd” as the name of the object 
... and “ensure => present” as the action to be performed on the object.

... So if I wanted puppet to install a mysql database server, the configuration would be

node ‘vps.client.com’ {

package { ‘mysql-server’:
ensure => installed,
   }
}

... The puppet server will compile this configuration into a catalog and 
... serve it to a client when a request is sent to it.

... How do I pull my configuration to a client immediately?
... Puppet client’s usually pull configuration once every 30 minutes, But
... you can pull a configuration immediately buy running “service puppet 
... restart or the following command.

... What if I wanted puppet to add a user ‘Tom’?
... Then the object would be user, the name of the object would be ‘tom’ 
... and the action would be ‘present’.

[user@puppet ~]# sudo puppet agent --test

node ‘vps.client.com’ {
     user { ‘tomr’ :
     ensure => present,
     }
}

... In puppet terms, these objects are known as Resources, the name of the 
... objects are Titles and the actions are called Attributes.

... Puppet has a number of these resources to help ease your automation, 
... You can read about them at http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html

...... How to ensure a service is running with puppet?

... Once you have package like apache installed, you will want to ensure
... that it is running. On the command line you can do this with the service
... command, However in puppet you will need to use the manifest file and 
... add the configuration as follows.

node ‘vps.client.com’ {
     package { ‘httpd’ :  
     	ensure => installed, 
     }
     ->
     service { ‘httpd’ :  	#Our resource and it’s title
        ensure => running,  	#Action to be performed on resource or attribute
        enable => true,   	# Start apache at boot
     }
}

... Now you must have noticed I have added an “->” symbol. This is because 
... Puppet is not particular about ordering, But we want the service command 
... to run only after apache is installed and not before, hence I have added the 
... arrow symbol which tells Puppet to run only after “httpd” is installed.
... To know more about puppet ordering read.

.....  How to automate installation of predefined conf files?

... You may want to have a customised apache conf file for this client, 
... which will have the vhost entry and other specific parameters you choose. 
... In this case we need to use the file resource.

... Before we go into the configuration, you should know how puppet serves 
... files. A Puppet server provides access to custom files via mount points. 
... One such mount point by default is the modules directory.
... The modules directory is where you would add your modules. Modules make 
... it easier to reuse configurations, rather than having to write configurations
... for every node we can store them as a module and call them whenever we like.

... In order to write a module, you need to create a subdirectory inside the 
... modules directory with the module name and create a manifest file called 
... init.pp which should contain a class with the same name as the subdirectory.

[user@puppet ~]# cd /etc/puppet/modules
[user@puppet ~]# mkdir httpd
[user@puppet ~]# mkdir -p httpd/manifests httpd/files
[user@puppet ~]# vim httpd/manifests/init.pp


class httpd {     #Same name as our Sub Directory
	package { 'httpd':
      	ensure => present,
        }
      	->

	file {'/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf':  		#Path to file on the client we want puppet to administer
     	ensure  => file,  				#Ensure it is a file, 
     	mode => 0644,    				#Permissions for the file
     	source => 'puppet:///modules/httpd/httpd.conf',	#Path to our customised file on the puppet server
     	}
     	->
	service { 'httpd':
      	ensure     => running,
      	enable     => true,
      	subscribe => File['/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf']  # Restart service if any any change is made to httpd.conf
	}
}

... You need to add your custom httpd.conf file in the files 
... subdirectory located at “/etc/puppet/modules/httpd/files/”

... Now call the module in our main manifest file.


[user@puppet ~]#sudo vim /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
node ‘vps.client.com’ {
             include httpd
	}
