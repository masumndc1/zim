... taken out of chatgpt output:
... one of the example of operator is @@ symbol in manifest file:
...
... the `@@` operator is a part of **exported resources**, a feature Puppet uses when
... a **Puppet master with multiple agents**.

## Normal resources

A plain resource looks like this:

file { '/tmp/hello':
  ensure  => present,
  content => "Hello World\n",
}

... This just manages a file on the current node.


## Exported resources (`@@`)

If:

@@file { '/tmp/hello':
  ensure  => present,
  content => "Hello World\n",
}

... That resource is not applied locally. Instead,
... it is **exported** to PuppetDB (or the Puppet master’s storeconfigs database).

## Collecting exported resources

... On another node, you can then **collect** those resources using a collector expression:

File <<| |>>

... This means:
... Gather all exported `file` resources (`@@file`) from PuppetDB
... Apply them here

## Example use case

... Classic example: **SSH authorized keys** sharing between nodes.
... On each node, export its SSH key:

@@ssh_authorized_key { $::hostname:
  ensure => present,
  user   => 'root',
  type   => 'ssh-rsa',
  key    => $::ssh_rsa_key,
}

... On a central node (e.g. bastion host), collect all keys:

Ssh_authorized_key <<| |>>

... Result -> every node’s SSH key is gathered and installed on the bastion.


## Summary

... `resource` -> normal local resource
... `@@resource` -> exported resource (sent to PuppetDB/storeconfigs, not applied locally)
... `Resource <<| |>>` -> collector that pulls in exported resources
... In short: `@@` means “export this resource so it can be collected elsewhere.”
