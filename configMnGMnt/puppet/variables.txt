... variables in puppet follows the following rules

$myvar 		# valid . they start with small letter and underscore.
$MyVar 		# invalid as variable should start with small letter
$my_var 	# valid
$my-var 	# invalid
$my3numbers 	# valid
$3numbers 	# invalid as should not start with numbers.

... we have one sample manifest with variables

$my_name = 'masum'
$num_tokens = '030905'

notify { grettings:
 message => "hello $my_name and your roll is $num_tokens"
}

... gives output when we run it

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# puppet apply sometest.pp

Notice: Compiled catalog for controller in environment production in 0.21 seconds
Notice: hello masum and your roll is 030905
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Notify[grettings]/message: defined 'message' as 'hello masum and your roll is 030905'
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.02 seconds

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests#


... another example

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# cat sometest.pp

$my_name = 'masum'
$num_tokens = '030905'

# now watching the variable type.
# this stdlib is a module installed by
# puppet module install puppetlabs-stdlib

include stdlib
$nametype = type_of( $my_name )
$numtype = type_of( $num_tokens )

notify { valtype:
 message => "masum is $nametype and 030905 is $numtype type variable"
}

... output of the sometest.pp is

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# puppet apply sometest.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for controller in environment production in 0.16 seconds

... arrays

$embedded = [4,5,['a','b']]   				# mixed of arrays.

... Array-to-array assignment works if there are equal
... variables and values:

[$first,$middle,$last] = ['md','khabir','uddin'] 	# good
[$first,$middle,$last] = ['md',undef,'uddin'] 		# good
[$first,$middle,$last] = ['md','uddin'] 		# error

myfunction( *$array_of_arguments ) { ... }

... Some functions require a list of input values, instead of an array.
... In a function call, the splat operator (*) operator will convert
... an Array into a comma-separated list of values:
... This provides a concise, readable way to pass a list of unknown size to a function.

... hashes:
... hash defination can be like below.
... Hash keys must be Scalar (string or number), but values can be any data type.
... This means that the value assigned to a key could be a nested Array or Hash.

$homes = { 'masum' => '/home/masum', 'khabir' => '/home/khabir', }

... and the usages of hashes and the array is like below.

$my_list=['bread','butter','oil']
$homes = { 'masum' => '/home/masum', 'khabir' => '/home/khabir', }
notice ( " the home directory of masum is ${homes['masum']} " )
notice ( " masum likes ${my_list[0]} with ${my_list[1]}. " )

... and the output of this is follows.

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# puppet apply longline.pp

Notice: Scope(Class[main]):  the home directory of masum is /home/masum
Notice: Scope(Class[main]):  masum likes bread with butter.

... we have another following pp

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# cat -n sometest.pp
     1	include stdlib
     2	# we are here making some test on variable
     3	$my_name = 'masum'

     5
     6	notice ( "hello ${my_name} and your roll is ${num_tokens}" )

    11
    12	notice ( "masum is ${nametype} and 030905 is ${numtype} type variable" )

... and its output is follows. notice how we assign variable and how we recall.

... variable validations:
... In a class, we can define type of the variables like bellow,
... if you are unsure of a variable's type or a variable is accepting
... multi-types of variables, then you should leave it blank.

class puppet (
  # input parameters and default values for the class
  String $version = 'latest',
  Enum['running','stopped'] $status = 'running',
  Boolean $enabled = true,
)

... hiera or lookup call
... getting value for a varilable for hiera data by using hiera/lookup.
...
... general format of hiera call and a call.
...

$varabl = hiera(value, default_value)
$status = hiera('specialapp::status', 'running')

... on the other hand, more detailed example of lookup call.

$status = lookup({
  name => 'specialapp::id',
  merge => 'unique',
  default_value => [],
  value_type => Array[Data],
 })

... also possible to add some logic and loop and checkings inside loopup call.

# Create a default value on request
$salt = lookup('security::salt') |$key| {
  # ignore key; generate a random salt every time
  rand(2**256).to_s(24)
}

... conditional value selections for a variable

$nova_private_key_file = $nova_private_key['type'] ? {
  'ssh-rsa'   => '/var/lib/nova/.ssh/id_rsa',
  'ssh-dsa'   => '/var/lib/nova/.ssh/id_dsa',
  'ssh-ecdsa' => '/var/lib/nova/.ssh/id_ecdsa',
   default    => undef
