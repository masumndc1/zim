... configure file like below.

[root@salt salt]# cd /etc/salt
[root@salt salt]# ls
master  minion  minion.d  pki
[root@salt salt]# cat master | grep file_roots

file_roots:

 - /srv/salt
 webserver:
 - /srv/web

[root@salt salt]#

... we are configuring base enviroment files can be found /srv/salt
... and webserver environment files can be found in /srv/web directory.
... we can also add separate topfiles as well.
... and our main base topfile is located at /srv/salt/top.sls

... let change the content of the top file of /srv/salt/top.sls

[root@salt salt]# pwd
/srv/salt
[root@salt salt]# ls
