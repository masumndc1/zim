... we can add our state files in top files. these state files
... are related to container executions.

→ pwd
/srv/salt/docker-master
→ cat top.sls
include:
 - .packages
 - .srvce
 - .file
 - .debian
→
... and in the debian.sls file, our state declarations are there

→ cat debian.sls
debian:
  docker_image.present:
    - tag: latest

mydebian:
  docker_container.running:
    - image: debian
    - sls:
       - nginx
       - vim
    - port_bindings: {8080: 80}
    - command: sleep infinity

→ cat nginx.sls
nginx:
 pkg.installed

→ cat vim.sls
vim:
  pkg.installed
→

... we havenot added nginx.sls and vim.sls in top.sls file because that will
... execute nginx and vim in docker-master node. not in the container node.
