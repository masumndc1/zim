... docker is build on client and server/daemon model.
... there is another third elements which is registry.
... client works like tell the server what to do. server
... on the other hand does running and managing the container.
... the optional registry stores the images and metadata for
... docker.

... docker server can run on multiple machines which then
... got the commands from docker clients. server can directly
... communicates with registry for images and meta data.

... interesting thing with docker is that it works unlike to
... other client/server model. the same executable works both
... for client and server model. the command docker with the
... options -d telling docker works as server/daemon and just
... docker command is like client simply. docker server can
... only work on linux based host.

... docker client can talk with it server or daemon by using tcp port or
... unix sockets. tcp port 2375 for unencrypted data and port 2376
... for the crypted communication between client and server.

... docker has extensive range of APIs along with strong command line
... tools. most of the things done with cli can be done with api too
... except streaming and terminal access. the later couple of work
... are bit easier to do with cli.

... we have to keep in mind that containers are not virtual machines.
... typically containers are lightweight. a newly container can be
... as small as few kilobytes where a freshly created virtual machine
... can be few hundreds megabytes.
