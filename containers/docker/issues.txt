... if docker is failing for cgroup issue, fix is below.
... if Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker is set 
... to systemd. 

... then create /etc/docker/daemon.json and add below:

{
    "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}

 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl restart docker
 sudo systemctl restart kubelet

...
... if we need to start/stop/restart any service inside a docker
... do following.

# service --help
# service --status-all
# service ssh start
# service ssh --full-restart

...
