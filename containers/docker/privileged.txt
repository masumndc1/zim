... to run a docker container like a small os, we need to run
... docker in privileged mode.

... To run a full operating system in a container 
... create the following Dockerfile:

FROM fedora:25

CMD /sbin/init

... Then build and start the container and enter a shell 
... inside it to explore the services running inside it:

docker build -t os .
docker run -d --privileged --name os os
docker exec -it os bash
