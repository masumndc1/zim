... enabling one local registry

... If the /etc/docker/daemon.json file does not exist, create it.
... Assuming there are no other settings in the file, it should have the following contents:

{
  "insecure-registries" : ["myregistrydomain.com:5000"]
}

... other options instead of myregistrydomain.com are localhost or ip of the registry host.
... in this example we are going to use localhost.

{
  "insecure-registries" : ["localhost:5000"]
}

... now run following command.

... Requirements The Registry is compatible with Docker engine version 1.6.0 or higher.

... Start your registry

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2

... Pull (or build) some image from the hub

docker pull ubuntu

... Tag the image so that it points to your registry

docker tag ubuntu localhost:5000/my-ubuntu:latest

... Push it to registry

docker push localhost:5000/my-ubuntu:latest

... Pull it back

docker pull localhost:5000/my-ubuntu:latest

... Now stop your registry and remove all data

docker stop registry && docker rm -v registry

[root@openshift docker]# docker stop registry
registry
[root@openshift docker]# docker start registry

... and way to start the registry again.

[root@openshift docker]# docker start registry
registry
[root@openshift docker]#
