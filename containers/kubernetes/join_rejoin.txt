... for some reason if you need to delete a nodes and rejoin that nodes
... into cluster, follow steps bellow.

... on controller nodes:
kubectl get nodes
... Migrate pods from the nodeA
kubectl drain nodeA --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
... Prevent a node from scheduling new pods use – Mark node as unschedulable
kubectl cordon nodeA
... finally delete node
... kubectl delete nodes nodeA

... on nodes:
... Revert changes made to the node
... by ‘kubeadm join‘
... Run on worker node to be removed
sudo kubeadm reset

... when again rejoining
... On controller:
... check token
kubeadm token list
... if you need to create a token
sudo kubeadm token create
... run this command on nodes.
... generate token and rejoin command at the same time
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
