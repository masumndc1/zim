... performance impact.
... following are some commands used to build and run first lxd container

... You can generally hit Enter to accept the default answers to the questions,
...  and once you’re setup you can start to launch machines.

sudo lxd init

lxc launch ubuntu: first-machine

... however we can also run various os by lxc by following
... list of other os can be found from https://uk.images.linuxcontainers.org/
... upto write this doc we can fun alpine, ubuntu, debian, centos and oracle.

lxc launch ubuntu:14.04 my-ubuntu
lxc launch ubuntu-daily:16.04 my-ubuntu-dev
lxc launch images:centos/6/amd64 my-centos
lxc launch images:centos/6/i386 my-centos32

... see your machine running

lxc list

... Jump into that container
... Type ‘exit’ to quit the container and return to your host. 
... Launch more containers and see how quickly they start. Install 
... SSH and log into them remotely, they behave just like real machines.

lxc exec first-machine bash

... we run the command inside the lxc container

lxc exec my-ubuntu -- apt-get update

... after installing lxd in centos by using install_lxd_centos.sh we can run following.

$ lxc image list images:
$ lxc image list images: | grep -i centos
$ lxc image list images: | grep -u ubuntu
