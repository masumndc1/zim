... vagrant file now written with the syntax 2 but this is also backward
... compatible with the version 1. following is the one exaple of version 1
... syntax. vagrant file is written with ruby programming language syntax.

... a simple configuration block found in a sample vagrant file is as follows.

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
	config.vm.box = "precise64"
	config.vm.share_folder "v-root", "/vagrant", "."
	config.vm.provision "shell" do |s|
		s.path = "script.sh"
	end
end

... and some of the explanations are as follows.

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|

... the following line is a simple variable assignment

	config.vm.box = "precise64"

... the next line is just like one function call and three
... variables are passed to it.

	config.vm.share_folder "v-root", "/vagrant", "."

...
	config.vm.provision "shell" do |s|
		s.path = "script.sh"
	end
end

... the equivalent code written in version 2 syntax are as follows

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
 	config.vm.box = "FreeBSD 10.1 i386"
	config.vm.box_url = "http://iris.hosting.lv/freebsd-10.1-i386.box"
end

... with the version 2 vagrant in the folder we can run following to
... download the box and install them.

$ vagrant box add {title} {url}
$ vagrant init {title}
$ vagrant up

... following is the site from where we can download some good vagrant file.
