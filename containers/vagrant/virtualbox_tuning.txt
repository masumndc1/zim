... this are some options we can do with virtualbox
... this are really useful I have found them working with freebsd.

config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
  v.name = "my_vm"
end

...

config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
  v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "50"]
end

... In the example above, the VM is modified to have a host CPU execution cap of 50%,
... meaning that no matter how much CPU is used in the VM,
... no more than 50% would be used on your own host machine. Some details:
... The :id special parameter is replaced with the ID of the virtual machine being created,
... so when a VBoxManage command requires an ID, you can pass this special parameter.

... Multiple customize directives can be used. They will be executed in the order given.


... There are some convenience shortcuts for memory and CPU settings:

config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
  v.memory = 1024
  v.cpus = 2
end
