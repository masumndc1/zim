.. therefore dns is damn important for webserver and mailserver and their delivery
.. moreover dns offers us easy way to remember web and mailserver name rather
.. than their difficult ip address. dns also act as routing in a sense say when
.. one type www.facebook.com or mail.facebook.com in their browser then browser connect with its own
.. configured dns server. dns server then reply the query of where is www.facebook.com?
.. it then reply with ip address pointing to www.facebook.com and mail.facebook.com and then routing 
.. takes places and go to that ip address and knock at webserver or mail server 
.. fetch webpage or email. therefore dns server plays a vital role in webserver and email delivery.

.. my previous example where i configured mail and web server and use masum.com
.. as my domain name. if i configured my own dns then the configuration would be
.. like below.

.. MX entry is important for the mail server
.. www entry important for the webserver like
.. www IN 192.168.35.10

.. and my dns entry would be like below in forwarding zone file

$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA masum.com. hostmaster.masum.com.
