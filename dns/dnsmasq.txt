... installing dnsmasq in ubuntu.

apt-get update
apt-get install dnsmasq

... edit configuration file like below

└──╼ # egrep -v ^# /etc/dnsmasq.conf

... setting the following interfaces only to listen dns and dhcp request.
... requests coming to other interface will be denied.

interface=virbr0
interface=vmnet8

cache-size=1000

... enable logging to a file instead of syslog

log-queries
log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq.log

... if we need dnsmasq to check other dns server instead of /etc/resolv.conf 
... we will do them like below.

resolv-file=/etc/resolv.orig

... the content of my resolv-file is. 
... when dns request comes to dnsmasq, then it will forward those request
... to the following nameservers. 

└──╼ # cat /etc/resolv.orig 

nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 9.9.9.9
nameserver 4.2.2.1
nameserver 4.2.2.2

┌─[root@elxabl1vvp2]─[/home/edmudoh]
└──╼ # 

... finally restart the dnsmasq service

└──╼ # systemctl restart dnsmasq

... and see the log file /var/log/dnsmasq.log

... in the client we need to configure this dnsmasq server ip address
... as dns server in /etc/resolv.conf. 

... we can install NetworkManager, dhcpclient, resolvconf or systemresolv 
... program in client to setup dnsmasq ip address as dns server automatically.

... i have found this setup working fine.
