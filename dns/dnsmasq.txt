... installing dnsmasq in ubuntu.

apt-get update
apt-get install dnsmasq

... edit configuration file like below

└──╼ # egrep -v ^# /etc/dnsmasq.conf

... setting the following interfaces only to listen dns and dhcp request.
... requests coming to other interface will be denied.
... now we want dnsmasq listen to every interface it has.
...

#interface=virbr0
#interface=vmnet8
listen-address=127.0.0.1
cache-size=1000

... enable logging to a file instead of syslog

log-queries
log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq.log

... if we need dnsmasq to check other dns server instead of /etc/resolv.conf 
... we will do them like below.

resolv-file=/etc/resolv.orig

... the content of my resolv-file is. 
... when dns request comes to dnsmasq, then it will forward those request
... to the following nameservers. we are adding only 3 here. we can use 4/5/6
... if we need or wish.

└──╼ # cat /etc/resolv.orig 

nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

┌─[root@elxabl1vvp2]─[/home/edmudoh]
└──╼ # 

... finally restart the dnsmasq service

└──╼ # systemctl restart dnsmasq

... and see the log file /var/log/dnsmasq.log

... in the client we need to configure this dnsmasq server ip address
... as dns server in /etc/resolv.conf. 

... we can install NetworkManager, dhcpclient, resolvconf or systemresolv 
... program in client to setup dnsmasq ip address as dns server automatically.

... i have found this setup working fine.
