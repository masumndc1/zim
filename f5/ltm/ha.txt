// to configure two f5 servers to be in active/standby mode we have configure them several things step by step.

1. to configure two f5 servers for the active/standby mode the servers must have the followings.

a. management interface configured.
b. modules are licensed and provisioned.
c. valid device certificates are configured.
d. fqdn cofigured.
e. server clock is synchronised. ie ntp should be configured.
f. networking like vlan and the self ip should be configured.
g. admin username and passwords.
h. should take the backup.

// many of the tasks have to configured using the setup utility.

// normaly we can use the existing vlan for the ha configuration but f5 recommends that we use the 
// separate vlan for that. for the simulating purpose we will do with one of the existing vlan. 

// setup utility/ high availability network configuration/ and select the existing vlan and the type 
// internal select the ip like 172.16.1.31/16. vlan interface 1.1 and untagged one.
// when we press the next tab it will go to the configsync configuration.

// on the configsync configuration we will not select the floating ip. we will not do that.
// we will select the self ip which one is the fixed one. remember not to select the floating ip.

// on the failover unicast configuration we will have 172.16.1.31 as internal vlan ip and 
// 192.168.1.31 as the management ip address. management ip address will use communication when
// the vlan ip is not functional. 

// next thing is the mirroring. on the tab we will select the self 172.16.1.31 not floating ip address
