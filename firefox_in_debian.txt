First, you need to remove the existing Iceweasel package (I think you can use aptitude as well):

apt-get remove iceweasel

Then, download the latest Linux build of Firefox directly from Mozilla. Extract the files, and navigate to that folder, and run it. If you want, make an icon on your desktop. You can also make a link to the binary in /usr/bin/firefox to make it easier to launch.

If you want a package-based one, you can use Linux Mint's Debian package repo. To do this, add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://packages.linuxmint.com debian import
And add the GPG key for that repo. Then, just run:

apt-get update
apt-get install firefox

And you should be good to go!

The default install is German, to install in any other language, you can manually run:

apt-get install firefox-l10n-en-us
Or use firefox-l10n-en-gb for British English.

If you have ever played around with the Debian distribution proper, you will quickly notice that Firefox is not available as a browser and in its place is something called IceWeasel. Here I will show you how to install the real Firefox browser on Debian 7.

The first step is to remove the IceWeasel package if it’s installed:

$ sudo apt-get remove iceweasel
Next, we will make use of a Linux Mint package repository that targets Debian proper. To do this add the following line to you /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://packages.linuxmint.com debian import
Now when you update your package list you will see an error like so:

$ sudo apt-get update
... a ton of output ...
W: GPG error: http://packages.linuxmint.com debian Release: The following
signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
NO_PUBKEY 3EE67F3D0FF405B2
This happens because you don’t have the proper key for the Linux Mint repository. To get a valid PGP key do the following:


$ sudo gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 3EE67F3D0FF405B2
$ sudo gpg --export 3EE67F3D0FF405B2 > 3EE67F3D0FF405B2.gpg
$ sudo apt-key add ./3EE67F3D0FF405B2.gpg
$ sudo rm ./3EE67F3D0FF405B2.gpg
Now you should be able to update the package list successfully. Then what’s left to do is to install firefox and you can do that like so:

$ sudo apt-get install firefox firefox-l10n-en-us
Enjoy firefox!
