// big ip uses say two vlan like vlan internal and other is vlan external.
// and also say vlan external has two ips like below.

vlan-external:
self ip: 10.10.1.31/16
floating self ip: 10.10.1.33/16

vlan-internal:
self ip: 172.16.1.31/16
floating self ip: 172.16.1.33/16

now during auto map big ip uses one of the self ip as its for the source
ip translation. its depends on how the traffic is destined.
on other words one of the self ip is used in the time of auto mapping.

// now what happens when a request comes from client for the service.

say client 10.10.1.30:55555 send a request to virtual server ip
10.10.1:100:80 then f5 will send the request to the internal servers
at that time the source ip will be 172.16.1.33 cz it is on the virtual
internal side and the destination will be one of the pools like
172.16.20.1:80.

and reverse happens from server side to the clients side. like
source: 172.16.20.1 destination: virtual-internal self ip: 172.16.1.33
as the term of server side.

and the client side will be source: 10.10.1.100:80 to client: 10.10.1.30:55555
