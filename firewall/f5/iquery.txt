// the communication between two big ip servers is done by the 
// irule called iquery. 

// we have to do this by command line like below

root@bigip config # bigip_add 10.10.15.31     		# the ip we need to to add with this one.

// this will then communicate with using the certificates between them.
// they will use the ssh to communicate therefore it has to be allow port
// 22 between them. along this we will need the root passward of the remote 
// bigip system.


// also when we need to add another dns server and need to synchronys them together
// then we will use gtm_add 10.10.4.31 dns server.
