// what we are going to do is creating ssl connection
// from our client to f5 server. that means the encrypting
// the connections. though from the server to the f5 will be
// unencrypted. to do so we are going to do following steps.

1. creating the pools all are https 443 connections as well as
http 80 port connections.

local trafic/ pool/ pool list/ new pool then create two pool
list one for the 80 ports and another for the 443 pool
and name them and port them.

2. now we will create the virtual server 10.10.1.100 for both
normal http and https connections. and connect with the associated
pool.

3. now create the ssl_client and connect it with the virtual server
and the port 443.

system/ file management/ ssl certificate list/ and create for the new
certificates.

new certificate name: testcertificates.
and keep the all the default value for this example but we can
change as our need and click on finished and create the one.

4. create a new ssl profile and connect our newly testcertificate with it.

name: masum_new_certificate
parentprofile: clientssl

click on custom and select
certificate: testcertificate which is newly just created
key: testcertificate too (optional)

now assoicate this masum_new_certificate to virtuals server for 443 port

5. now one more interesting thing to consider as we place masum_new_certificate
with client side to f5 and no cert from f5 to server side then we will not
get the connections. therefore we have to remedy of this things.

the remedy is to select the http_pool(80) from the resource pool.
local traffic/virtualserver/ virtual list/ vs_ssl click on it
then select http_pool from the resource tab and update.

now try to connect from 10.10.1.100 it will be ok. client 10.10.1.30 to f5
10.10.1.100 is encrypted and 10.10.1.100 to server pools(172.16.20.1-3) is
un encrypted.
