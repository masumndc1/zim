// which we have done is allow the http,https,ping,ssh and telnet
// now we will be allowed to do these.

// now we will connect the device via http the configure key and
// then will connect using ssh and https.

// now browse like http://192.168.35.139

// for example we want to disable dst (daylight saving time) by cli
// we do like below, dst enabled by default. here also note the
// travelsal of cli to cli

// default gateway configuration
// we want to enable the internet of our router
// and will use it like a nat router. ok fine
// to do so we will set the default gateway like below
// and test the connectivity.
// first we configure our port1 as external (192.168.35.139/24)
// therefore our gateway will be 192.168.35.1
// and will mark this interface as outside.
// we will also configure dns name also. and
// test like below.

// we will set parameters from system/network tab
// and select the interface port1 and click and
// enter parameters there.

// now configure the static route
// router/static/static routes
// and add a default route (0/0) with the following parameter
// and gateway 192.168.35.1 interface port1

// example
// same way we can also add other static route like
// 172.16.1.0/24 will go through port7 with the ip 17.35.1.1
// and test it like below.
