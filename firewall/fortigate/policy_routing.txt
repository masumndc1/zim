// that mean you have to put the entry on

// enable the natting on policy pan also.
// after the successful entry you can see the

// one of the sample policy route entry is like below.
// here is showing if any dns traffic reached at
// port2 from 192.168.244.0/24 the it will go out
// of the port3 and the dns-server will be 4.2.2.0/30
// ie 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2
