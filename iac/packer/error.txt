... I have encounter some error during running packer against my esxi server.
...
... I needed to enable ssh in esxi server. We need to enable TSM-SSH service.

... Enalbe guest IP hack: to enable this run the following
... # esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1

... Then we need to open vnc port in esxi through firewall services.
... For this, documentation is in virtualization/vmware/firewall.txt
...
... we also need to set "vnc_disable_password": "true", in json template file in packer.
... and also "ssh_timeout": "10000s",
...
