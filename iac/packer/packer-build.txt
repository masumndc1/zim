... for the template of making ubuntu/debian os we can use packer-build tools

$ apt-get install ruby
$ git clone https://github.com/tylert/packer-build.git

~/packer/packer-build master ✓ > pwd
home/user/packer/packer-build
~/packer/packer-build master ✓ > ls
build    Makefile      post-processors  README.rst             requirements.txt  source    Vagrantfile.somewhatblank
LICENSE  packer_cache  raw_cmds         requirements_bare.txt  script            template
~/packer/packer-build master ✓ > ./script/generate_templates.sh

... the above command will generate template for the packer to make the os.
... then run the following

~/packer/packer-build master ✓ > ./script/vbox.sh template/ubuntu/16.04_xenial/base.json

... this will create a ova file to use in the virtual box, which can be found in the
... build folder. then just run that file in the virtual box and we will find a new running
... os in virtualbox.
