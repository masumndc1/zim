... we can use data to ask for data from provider 
... then we can also use the achieved data to reference in 
... another place.

# router external gateway data block here

data "openstack_networking_network_v2" "public" {
  name = "public"
}

# router block here

resource "openstack_networking_router_v2" "router3" {
  name           = "router3"
  admin_state_up = "true"
  external_network_id = "${data.openstack_networking_network_v2.public.id}"
}

... note here how we have used data reference in external_network_id.


... using data source in instance.tf file is nothing but query the provider
... for data. for example is given below.

data "vsphere_network" "mgmt_lan" {
  name          = "VM Network"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}

... above is an example of how block of data source is used. the working mechanism
... of data source here is, data will ask provider for "vshpere_network" information.
