... this is how we make an image for openstack by using terraform.


provider "openstack" {
  user_name   = "admin"
  tenant_name = "admin"
  password    = "admin"
  auth_url    = "http://192.168.122.204/identity"
  region      = "RegionOne"
}

resource "openstack_images_image_v2" "debian" {
  name   = "debian_image"
  local_file_path = "/home/edmudoh/qcow2/debian-9.7.0-openstack-amd64.qcow2"
  container_format = "bare"
  disk_format = "qcow2"
  visibility = "shared"
}
