... following is the way of generating keypair. and using the public key
... 

resource "openstack_compute_keypair_v2" "stack-keypair" {
  name       = "stack-keypair"
}

... and how to use the public key with the compute is follows.

resource "openstack_compute_keypair_v2" "test-keypair" {
  name       = "my-keypair"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDAjpC1hwiOCCmKEWxJ4qzTTsJbKzndLotBCz5PcwtU...
}

... another way of creating keypair by using already created public key

resource "openstack_compute_keypair_v2" "stack-keypair" {
  name       = "stack-keypair"
  public_key = "${file("/your/pubkey/file/location/id_rsa.pub")}"
}

... note here how we have used file keyword and how we have used ""

... now after creation of the instance, try to login using private key

# chmod 600 id_rsa
# ssh -i id_rsa debian@<server_ip>

... note here: dont use id_rsa.pub key to login.
... use id_rsa private key to login.
