... below an example how we can use terraform to create
... a router in openstack. and add external gateway and 
... internal subnet with the router.

# router external gateway data block here

data "openstack_networking_network_v2" "public" {
  name = "public"
}

# router block here
# creation of router here.

resource "openstack_networking_router_v2" "router3" {
  name           = "router3"
  admin_state_up = "true"
  external_network_id = "${data.openstack_networking_network_v2.public.id}"
}

# adding the internal subnet with router in an interface.

resource "openstack_networking_router_interface_v2" "int_1" {
  router_id = "${openstack_networking_router_v2.router3.id}"
  subnet_id = "${openstack_networking_subnet_v2.private2_subnet.id}"
}
