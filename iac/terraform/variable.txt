... resource type declaration
...
...

resource "provider_resourcename" "name" {
 [ series of config]
}

... variable declaration in Terraform
... we can declare one variable by using the keyword "variable".

... description
... For variable we can have description,default and type.
... description is good to use for why this variable is being used 
... in the code. while running plan or apply, this description will be displayed.

... default
... default value to pass. we can pass default value in command prompt by using
... -var options or from file -var-file or from environment variable like
... TF_VAR_<variable_name>. if no value is passed then it will try to set default
... to itselt. if terraform cant find value, then terraform will ask for a default value.

... type
... type must either of map, list, string. if no type is specified then Terraform
... assumes it as string.

... example of variable declaration

variable "variable_name" {
  description = "example of variable declaration"
  type = "list"
  default = [1, 2, 3]
}

... another example of variable declartion

variable "server_port" {
  description = "Port on which http will listen"
  type = "string"
  default = 80
}

... we can also pass the value of the variable in command line by following way

terraform plan -var server_port="8080"

... now to use the value of a variable we do the following in Terraform

"${var.variable_name}"

our variable declaration file is like below

[root@localhost terraform-test]# cat variables.tf
variable "vsphere_server" {
        description = "vsphere ip address"
        type = "string"
        default= "172.16.17.130"
}

variable "vsphere_user" {
        description = "administrative user"
        type = "string"
        default = "root"
}

variable "vsphere_password" {
        description = "administrative password"
        type = "string"
        default = "YourPasswordH3r3"
}

[root@localhost terraform-test]#

... and the usage of variable is below

[root@localhost terraform-test]# cat instance.tf

<output cut>
provider "vsphere" {
    vsphere_server = "${var.vsphere_server}"
    user = "${var.vsphere_user}"
    password = "${var.vsphere_password}"
    allow_unverified_ssl = true
}
<output cut>

... note here, how we use variable interpolation syntax here.
... we placed var first, then dot, then variable name. like

${var.vsphere_server}

... to output something in terraform we can do the following

[root@localhost terraform-test]# cat instance.tf

output "testing" {
  value = "${data.vsphere_datastore.datastore.id}"
}

[root@localhost terraform-test]# terraform output testing

... using data source in instance.tf file is nothing but query the provider
... for data. for example is given below.

data "vsphere_network" "mgmt_lan" {
  name          = "VM Network"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}

... above is an example of how block of data source is used. the working mechanism
... of data source here is, data will ask provider for "vshpere_network" information.
