at first we install the snort


first of all

by the command apt-get install snort
and the it will install all the required software it
needed also at the point ask for the network which
will work as home_net

now test the snort by the command
snort -evi eth0

options are below
 -e         Display the second layer header info
-v 		verbose mode
 -i     Listen on interface if
 -T         Test and report on the current Snort configuration

out particular interest in snort.conf is home_net addrese
we set it below

ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.195.1/24

this ip block we set for our local network facing ethernet.


now test snort for any errors again

snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

  To create the database in MySQL you can do the following:

  [ running as an mysql user with admin privileges ]
  $ mysql
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE snort;
  mysql> grant CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE on snort.* to snort@localhost;
  mysql> grant CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE on snort.* to snort;
  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR snort@localhost=PASSWORD('snort-db');
  mysql> flush privileges;
  [ you can confirm the changes above running ]
  mysql> show grants for 'snort'@'localhost';

  And then you can run the command above as:

  $ zcat create_mysql.gz | mysql -u snort -D snort -psnort-db

we also need to install barnyard2
On each host we are going to use Snort in network intrusion detection mode. To speed up its traffic processing it will log in binary mode. That’s where Barnyard2 comes into play.

Barnyard2 is an open source interpreter for Snort unified2 binary output files. Its primary use is allowing Snort to write to disk in an efficient manner and leaving the task of parsing binary data into various formats to a separate process that will not cause Snort to miss network traffic. It can also operate in three modes: Batch, Continual and Continual with bookmarking

Usage: oinkmaster -o  [options]

 is where to put the new files.
This should be the directory where you store your Snort rules.

Options:
-b
  Backup your old rules into
 before overwriting them
-c        Careful mode (dry run) - check for changes but do not update anything
-C  Use this configuration file instead of the default
          May be specified multiple times to load multiple files
-e        Enable all rules that are disabled by default
-h        Show this usage information
-i        Interactive mode - you will be asked to approve the changes (if any)
-m        Minimize diff when printing result by removing common parts in rules
-q        Quiet mode - no output unless changes were found
-Q        Super-quiet mode - like -q but even more quiet
-r        Check for rules files that exist in the output directory
          but not in the downloaded rules archive
-s        Leave out details in rules results, just print SID, msg and filename
-S  Look for new variables in this file in the downloaded archive instead
          of the default (snort.conf). Used in conjunction with -U.
          May be specified multiple times to search multiple files.
-T        Config test - just check configuration file(s) for errors/warnings
-u   Download from this URL instead of URL(s) in the configuration file
          (http|https|ftp|file|scp:// ... .tar.gz|.gz, or dir://
)
          May be specified multiple times to grab multiple rules archives
-U  Merge new variables from downloaded snort.conf(s) into
-v        Verbose mode (debug)
-V        Show version and exit




let see whereabout our snort rules are placed.

rules basics



Here’s the general form of a Snort rule:

action proto src_ip src_port direction dst_ip dst_port (options)

When a packet comes in, its source and destination IP addresses and ports
are compared to the rules in the ruleset. If any of the rules is applicable to
the packet, its options are then compared to the packet. If all of these com-
parisons return a match, the specified action is taken.





various action can be possible based on the following.

log - to log the packet
alert - alert as well as log the packet
pass - simply to pass the rule.
dynamic - dynamic rules which is simply a log rule but will considered importantly
		when this is activated by another rule. dynamic rules also
		use count as options to count number of packets.
activate - rules are activated by rule_id .

The last two built-in rule actions, activate and dynamic, are used together to
dynamically modify Snort’s ruleset at runtime. Rules that use the dynamic
action are just like log rules, except they will be considered only after they
have been enabled by an activate rule. To determine what dynamic rules to
enable once an activate rule has been triggered, Snort enforces the use of
the activates and activated_by rule options. In addition, dynamic rules are
required to specify a count option so that Snort can limit how many packets
the rules will record.

an simple example.


activate tcp any any -> 192.168.1.21 23 (content:"telnet"; activates 1; msg: "telnet overflow";)
dynamic tcp any any -> 192.168.1.21 23 (activated_by 1; count: 100;)

when telnet traffic from any ip addressed come to 192.168.1.21 with the destination port 23,
it then activates the rule no.1 which is a dynamic rule indicates that this dynamic ruls is
activated_by rule no.1 and also dynamic rules will count next 100 packets.


You can also define custom rule actions, in addition to Snort’s built-in
actions. This is done with the ruletype keyword:

ruletype redalert
{
	type alert
	output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
	output database: log, mysql, user=snort dbname=snort host=localhost
}


This custom rule action tells Snort that it behaves like the alert rule action,
but specifies that the alerts should be sent to the syslog daemon, while the
packets will be logged to a database. When defining a custom action, you
can use any of Snort’s output plug-ins, just as you would if you were
configuring them as your primary output method.

protocol field - snort supports ip,icmp,udp,tcp.

ip address fielt - snort support single ip, CIDR and multiple ipadress or ipaddress
		range with commas but no space and finally enclosed by square brackets.

port - range of port like 1:1024 :1024 1024: also ! (not operator to inverse them)

direction -    -> or \<\> later one is used with log and dynamic rules set cause it
		enables log packet to both sides.

options field
each option has number of plug-ins. snort has over 40 plug-ins. few of options are here.

msg: "human readable message";
content: "search able content will be placed inside within an double quote"
	 to search something ignoring case use nocase at the end of all the options.
	 to search hexadecimal number like x90 use them inside | | like
	 content:"|90|";

depth and offset -

if you want to limit content matches for NOP instruc-tions to between
bytes 40 and 75 of the data portion of a packet, you can modify the
previously shown rule to look like this:

alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Possible exploit"; offset:40; depth:75;)


You can
check the size of a packet’s data payload by using the dsize option. This
option takes a number as an argument. In addition, you can specify an
upper bound by using the < operator, or you can choose a lower bound by
using the > operator. Upper and lower bounds can be expressed with <>. For
example, the following line modifies the previous rule to match only if the
data payload’s size is greater than 6000 bytes, in addition to the other
options criteria:

alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Possible exploit"; offset:40; depth:75; dsize: >6000;)

matching tcp flags.

alert any any -> any any (flags:SF,12; msg:"Possible SYN FIN scan";)

Valid flags are S for SYN, F for FIN, R for RST, P for PSH, A for ACK, and U for URG.

In addition, Snort lets you check the values of the two reserved flag bits. You
can specify these by using either 1 or 2.

You can also match packets that have no flags set by using 0.
The flags option will accept several operators. You can prepend either a +, *, or ! to the flags,
to match on all the flags plus any others, any of the flags,
or only if none of the flags are set, respectively.



thresolding




when a rules creates lot of false positive then we can control its behaviour in a tolerance
level by using snort's thresolding. to enable thresolding to a rule we have to put rule in


root@debian:~# cat /etc/snort/threshold.conf
# Configure Thresholding and Suppression
# ======================================
#
# The threshold command is deprecated.  Use detection_filter for thresholds
# within a rule and event_filter for standalone threshold configurations.
# Please see README.filters for more information on filters.
#
# Thresholding:
#
# This feature is used to reduce the number of logged alerts for noisy rules.
# This can be tuned to significantly reduce false alarms, and it can also be
# used to write a newer breed of rules. Thresholding commands limit the number
# of times a particular event is logged during a specified time interval.
#
# There are 3 types of event_filters:
#
# 1) Limit
#    Alert on the 1st M events during the time interval, then ignore
#    events for the rest of the time interval.
#
# 2) Threshold
#    Alert every M times we see this event during the time interval.
#
# 3) Both
#    Alert once per time interval after seeing M occurrences of the
#    event, then ignore any additional events during the time interval.
#
# Threshold commands are formatted as:
#
# event_filter gen_id gen-id, sig_id sig-id, \
#     type limit|threshold|both, track by_src|by_dst, \
#     count n , seconds m
#
# Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds:
#
# event_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 1851, type limit, \
#     track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Global Threshold - Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds per IP triggering
# each rule (rules are gen_id 1):
#
# event_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 0, type limit, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Global Threshold - Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds per IP triggering
# any alert for any event generator:
#
# event_filter gen_id 0, sig_id 0, type limit, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Suppression:
#
# Suppression commands are standalone commands that reference generators and
# sids and IP addresses via a CIDR block (or IP list). This allows a rule to be
# completely suppressed, or suppressed when the causitive traffic is going to
# or comming from a specific IP or group of IP addresses.
#
# Suppress this event completely:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852
#
# Suppress this event from this IP:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852, track by_src, ip 10.1.1.54
#
# Suppress this event to this CIDR block:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852, track by_dst, ip 10.1.1.0/24
#

the above config file is enough to make it clear as the file is
self explanatory.



thresolding by signature id




the general rule is below. note thresold command is not included with snort any more.


 event_filter gen_id gen-id, sig_id sig-id, \
     type limit|threshold|both, track by_src|by_dst, \
     count n , seconds m


The generator ID gen_id is the portion of Snort that generates the alert you want
to threshold. This is used to track which preprocessor an alert came from.
Since all alerts for signatures are generated by Snort’s signature engine, this
should always be set to 1.


The signature ID corresponds to the signa-
ture’s ID. This, of course, means that you’ll need to specify IDs when writ-
ing your own rules. This is done with the sid option. You’ll also want to
specify the rule’s revision with the rev option.

For example, here’s a rule that we looked at before, but with sid and rev
options added:





alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Possible exploit"; content:"|90|"; \
	offset:40; depth:75; dsize: >6000; sid:1000001; rev:1;)



Note that only signature IDs greater than one million can be used for local
rules.

therefore to thresold a rule with signature id 1000001 in the rule just above
we should deploy following command.

event_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 1000001, \
     type both, track by_src 192.168.1.1,  by_dst 192.168.1.2, \
     count 1 , seconds 60

which means that the rule of signature id of 1000001 will be logged only 1 time within
the time limit of 60 seconds.




thresolding rule options



The other way to use thresholding is to
include the thresholding parameters in the rule itself. For instance, if some-
one were to actually send a bunch of packets toward your IDS with the SYN
and FIN flags set, the previously shown rule that would match them would
generate far too many alerts to be useful. So, let’s add some thresholding to
it:




alert any any -> any any (flags:SF,12; msg:"Possible SYN FIN scan"; \
event_filter: type both, track by_dest, count 100, seconds 60)



Now, the alert will trigger only once every minute for each IP address that it
sees receiving at least 100 SYN/FIN packets during that time period.

suppression



also we can suppress a rule by signature id too with the following command.


suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1000001, track by_src, ip 192.168.1.1, track by_dst 192.168.1.2
