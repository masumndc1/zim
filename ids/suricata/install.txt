... installing suricata on centos7 from source.

... before that i needed some dependency for my centos7.
... For Suricata’s compilation you’ll need the following libraries and their development headers installed:
... libpcap, libpcre, libmagic, zlib, libyaml
... The following tools are required:
... make gcc (or clang) pkg-config
... For full features, also add:
... libjansson, libnss, libgeoip, liblua5.1, libhiredis, libevent
... Rust support (experimental):
... rustc, cargo
... and we can install them like following.

# yum provide pcap.h
# yum install pcap-devel

# wget -c https://www.openinfosecfoundation.org/download/suricata-4.0.4.tar.gz
# tar zxvf suricata-4.0.4.tar.gz
# cd suricata-4.0.4
# ./configure 
# make 
# make install

... or we need to install configuration file and download the rulez too.

# make install-full

... If a library like libhtp.so is not found, you can run suricata with:

'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/suricata -c /usr/local/etc/suricata//suricata.yaml -i eth0'.

... downloading rules can be done by following

# /usr/bin/wget -qO - https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-4.0/emerging.rules.tar.gz | \
tar -x -z -C "/usr/local/etc/suricata/" -f -

... The two most common are Oinkmaster and Pulledpork for downloading rulez. For a guide see:

https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/wiki/Rule_Management_with_Oinkmaster

[root@localhost suricata-4.0.4]# 

... starting suricata

[root@localhost ]# suricata -c /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
