i have two juniper routers. i want to set up tunnel between them.


adding routing option which is the lan ip for one router
set routing-options static route 192.168.4.0/24 next-hop st0.0



setting ike configuration
set security ike traceoptions file traffic-log
set security ike traceoptions flag all
set security ike proposal srx2-proposal authentication-method pre-shared-keys
set security ike proposal srx2-proposal dh-group group2
set security ike proposal srx2-proposal authentication-algorithm sha1
set security ike proposal srx2-proposal encryption-algorithm 3des-cbc
set security ike policy srx2-policy mode main
set security ike policy srx2-policy proposals srx2-proposal
set security ike policy srx2-policy pre-shared-key ascii-text
"$9$Z3j.5n6A0ORn/u1IEKv" # was 'secret'
set security ike gateway srx2-gateway ike-policy srx2-policy
set security ike gateway srx2-gateway address 10.10.10.9
set security ike gateway srx2-gateway external-interface ge-0/0/1.0



setting ipsec configuration
set security ipsec proposal srx2-proposal protocol esp
set security ipsec proposal srx2-proposal authentication-algorithm hmac-sha1-96
set security ipsec proposal srx2-proposal encryption-algorithm 3des-cbc
set security ipsec policy srx2-policy perfect-forward-secrecy keys group5
set security ipsec policy srx2-policy proposals srx2-proposal
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn bind-interface st0.0
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn df-bit clear
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn vpn-monitor optimized
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn ike gateway srx2-gateway
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn ike ipsec-policy srx2-policy
set security ipsec vpn srx2-ipsec-vpn establish-tunnels on-traffic



and zone configuration


set security policies from-zone vpn-zone to-zone internet policy allow-traffic match source-address any
set security policies from-zone vpn-zone to-zone internet policy allow-traffic match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone vpn-zone to-zone internet policy allow-traffic match application any
set security policies from-zone vpn-zone to-zone internet policy allow-traffic then permit
set security policies from-zone internet to-zone vpn-zone policy allow-traffic match source-address any
set security policies from-zone internet to-zone vpn-zone policy allow-traffic match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone internet to-zone vpn-zone policy allow-traffic match application any
set security policies from-zone internet to-zone vpn-zone policy allow-traffic then permit

these two lines are important
set security zones security-zone internet interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ike
set security zones security-zone vpn-zone interfaces st0.0
