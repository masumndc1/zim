... basic of kubernetes implementation.

... in kuberneters environment there is one master and several minions or nodes.
... in the kubernetes master the service etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler,
... and kube-controller-manager and in the minion docker, flannel, kube-proxy 
... kubelet run.

... etcd is a simple, secure, fast and reliable distributed key-value store.
... Kubernetes master uses API to select the containers running on nodes to handle tasks. 
... kubelet is an agent that runs on each node to monitor the containers running on the node,
... restarting them if required to keep the replication level.

... A service proxy runs on each node to provide the Kubernetes service interface for clients. 
... The service proxy routes the client traffic to a matching pod. 
... Labels are used to match a service with a pod.

... the master components
... apiserver: The apiserver takes API requests, processes them, and stores the result in etcd
... if required and returns the result.
... The scheduler: monitors the API for unscheduled pods and schedules them on a node to run.
... The controller: manages the the pods, starting new pods in a scale up 
... event and stopping some of the pods in a scale down.
... The pause: keeps the port mappings of all the containers in the pod or the network endpoint of the pod.
