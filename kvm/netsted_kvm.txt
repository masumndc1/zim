... to run vm into another vm we need to enable nested kvm.

... By default, nested KVM is disabled.
... but we can enable it by following

... Open /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf as root user using a text editor like vim.
... If the file does not exist create /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf

	 #Uncomment kvm_intel line if your CPU make is Intel
	 #options kvm_intel nested=1

	 #Uncomment kvm_intel line if your CPU make is AMD
	 #options kvm_amd nested=1

... then reboot the system and check the following.

root@elxa6lj5k72:~# cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
Y
root@elxa6lj5k72:~# 

... For AMD, the file to check is /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested :

... run the following inside the vm to see the effect.

root@elxa6lj5k72:~# egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
root@elxa6lj5k72:~# egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
2
root@elxa6lj5k72:~# 

... i have found they are working right..
