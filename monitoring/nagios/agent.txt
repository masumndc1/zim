... Add Monitoring targets to Nagios server
... Now let us add some clients to monitor by Nagios server. To do that we have to install nrpe and 
... nagios-plugins in our monitoring targets.

... Install “nrpe” and “nagios-plugins” packages in client systems to be monitored.

# yum install nrpe nagios-plugins-all openssl

... Configure Monitoring targets. edit /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg file,

# vi /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg

       Add your Nagios server ip address
       [...]
## Line 81 - Add the Nagios server IP ##
       allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1 192.168.1.101
       [...]

... Start nrpe service:

# service nrpe start
# chkconfig nrpe on

... Now go back to your Nagios server to add the clients to be monitored through nagios server. Edit “/etc/nagios/nagios.cfg” file,

# vi /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg

       and uncomment the following lines.
## Line 52 - Uncomment ##
       cfg_dir=/etc/nagios/servers

... Create a directory called “servers” under “/etc/nagios/”.

# mkdir /etc/nagios/servers

... Create config file to the client to be monitored:

# vi /etc/nagios/servers/clients.cfg

       define host{
	       use                             linux-server
	       host_name                       client
	       alias                           client
	       address                         192.168.1.100
	       max_check_attempts              5
	       check_period                    24x7
	       notification_interval           30
	       notification_period             24x7
       }

... Finally restart nagios service.

# service nagios restart

... Now open the nagios admin console in the browser and navigate to “Hosts” section in the left pane. 
... You will see the newly added client will be visible there. Click on the host to see if there is anything wrong or alerts.
... Click on the monitoring target, you’ll get the detailed output:
... Like this way, you can define more clients by creating a separate config files “/etc/nagios/servers directory for each client.

... Define services and monitor the service in a host

... We did define the monitoring host before. Now let us add some services of the monitoring host.
... For example to monitor the ssh service, add the following lines shown in red colour in the /etc/nagios/servers/clients.cfg file.

# vi /etc/nagios/servers/clients.cfg

       define host{
	       use                             linux-server
	       host_name                       client
	       alias                           client
	       address                         192.168.1.100
	       max_check_attempts              5
	       check_period                    24x7
	       notification_interval           30
	       notification_period             24x7
       }

       define service {
               use                             generic-service
               host_name                       client
               service_description             SSH
               check_command                   check_ssh
               notifications_enabled           0
       }

... Save and close the file. Restart Nagios.

# service nagios restart

... Now log in to Nagios web console and check for the added services. 
... Navigate to Services section, you’ll see the ssh service there.
