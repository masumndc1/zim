... Scenario

... In this tutorial i am going to use two systems as mentioned below.
... Nagios server:
... Operating system : CentOS 6.5 minimal installation
... IP Address       : 192.168.1.101/24
... Nagios client:
... Operating System : Ubuntu 13.04
... IP Address       : 192.168.1.100/24

... Prerequisites 

... Before installing Nagios, make sure that you’ve a properly installed and configured 
... LAMP stack in your server. To install and configure LAMP server, refer any one of the following links.

... Also install the following prerequisites too. All commands should be run as root user.

# yum install gd gd-devel gcc glibc glibc-common

... now going to install nagios 
... Nagios will not be found in CentOS official repositories, so let us add the EPEL 
... repository to install nagios. To add and enable EPEL repository, refer the following link.

# yum install epel-release

... Next install nagios with all plug-ins and nagios agents(nrpe-agent) using command:

# yum install nagios*

... note: It worked for me either if i keep SELINUX and iptables enable or disable. 
... All you need to do is allow the apache port through iptables as shown below.
... but its better to keep selinux disable or permissive.

# sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
# setenforce 0

... now configure iptables so that it allows 80 port

# vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables

      Add the following line:
      [...]
      -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
      [...]

      Save and close the file. Restart iptables.

# service iptables restart

... Configure Nagios
... Add the admin mail address in the nagios contact file to receive alerts from nagios server. 
... To do that edit file /etc/nagios/objects/contacts.cfg,
... this part is optional but good to have.

root@minion nagios]# pwd
/etc/nagios
[root@minion nagios]# ls
cgi.cfg  conf.d  nagios.cfg  objects  passwd  private
[root@minion nagios]#
[root@minion nagios]#

# vi /etc/nagios/objects/contacts.cfg

      Find the following line and enter the email id:
      [...]
      email                           sk@unixmen.com ;
      [...

... Save and close the file.

... Then Edit file /etc/httpd/conf.d/nagios.conf,

# vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/nagios.conf

... And edit the following lines if you want to access nagios administrative console from a particular IP series.
... Here i want to allow nagios administrative access from 192.168.1.0/24 series only.

      [...]
## Comment Lines 15 & 16 ##
#   Order allow,deny
#   Allow from all
## Uncomment and Change lines 17,18 & 19 as shown below ##
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
      Allow from 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.0/24
      [...]

... Set nagiosadmin password

# htpasswd /etc/nagios/passwd nagiosadmin

      New password:
      Re-type new password:
      Updating password for user nagiosadmin

... Start nagios and httpd services and let them to start automatically on every boot.

# systemctl enable nagios
# systemctl enable httpd 
# service nagios start
# service httpd start

... Access Nagios admin console
... Open nagios administrator console with URL http://nagios-server-ip/nagios and enter 
... the username as nagiosadmin and its password which we created in the earlier steps.

... This is how Nagios administrative console looks:

... Click on the “Hosts” section in the left pane of the console. You will see the no of
... hosts to be monitored by Nagios server. Initially, the nagios server (localhost) itself 
... will only be monitored.


... now we will need an monitoring agent in system to monitor and send
... status to nagios server. we will do that in agent.txt file.
