...... components and services of openstack...


... keystone
... this is identity and access management for all of the services in openstack.
... keystone itself has identity management, resource allocation, token managent
... policy etc. therefore when we use horizon or any other api to interact to
... other services within openstack we have to interact and grant access from it.
... This service is equivalent to the IAM service of the AWS public cloud

... horizon
... this is a web based interface or dashboard to manage openstack components
... including nova keystone and other.
... the equivalent of horizon in aws is aws console.

... nova
... nova is compute components for openstack. it support a lot of virtualization
... like lxc, kvm, xen, vmware etc. ec2 in aws is the same equivalent of this.

... glance
... glance manages the image files available to users.

... Swift
... The swift service is used to actually store Glance images.

... cinder
... the database service for openstack. in aws this is ebs.

... neutron
... neutron is the networking services for openstack. though basic networking is
... included with nova aditional networking services such as firewall as a service,
... load balancer as a services are provided by neutron. neutron is recommended for
... openstack networking for general to advance purpose.
... This is equivalent to multiple services in AWS such as ELB, Elastic IP, and VPC.

... Designate
... The Designate service offers DNS services equivalent to Route 53 of the AWS.

... Zaqar
... Zaqar is the messaging and notification service of OpenStack. This is equivalent to
... the SNS service from AWS.

... Barbican
... Barbican is the key management service of OpenStack that is comparable to KMS
... from AWS. This provides secure storage, retrieval, provisioning and management
... of various types of secret data such as keys, certificates, and even binary data.

... Magnum
... Magnum introduces Linux Containers such as Dockers and Kubernetes (by Google)
... to improve migration option. This service is in some ways like Trove, it uses
... an image with Docker installed on it and orchestrates Magnum with Heat. It is
... effectively Container as a Service (CaaS) of OpenStack.

... python code location:
... as we know openstack is fully written in python. therefore, python needs to take
... configuration settings out of component.conf (ie from /etc/keystone/keystone.conf)
... and then add that parameters to relevant python files.

... the location of python files resides in linux, for example.
... /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages directory
