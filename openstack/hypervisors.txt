... the supported cpu models of a hypervisor are determined by the following ways.

[root@host1]# virsh capabilities | grep model
      <model>Haswell-noTSX-IBRS</model>
    <secmodel>
      <model>selinux</model>
    </secmodel>
    <secmodel>
      <model>dac</model>
    </secmodel>
#

... therefore, the Haswell-noTSX-IBRS will be supported cpu_model for the guest vms
... running in this node.
