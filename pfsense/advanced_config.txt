.................. virtual ip ......................

.. the virtual ip can be configured in firewall/virtual ip
.. tab we are going to configue other type of virtual ip and
.. putting the parameters as our requirement.

.. the other type of virtual ip, vip has the following properties
.. 
.. a. traffic can only be forwared to this type of vip. pfsense cant 
.. use this type of vip as its own services.
.. b. ping is not allowed to this vip.
.. c. vip can be in different subnet than its interface.
.. 
.. there are other types of vip as follows.
..
.. CARP
.. Can be used or forwarded by the firewall
.. Uses Layer 2 traffic
.. Should be used in firewall fail-over or load-balancing scenarios
.. Must be in the same subnet as the interface
.. Will respond to pings if configured properly
..
.. Proxy ARP
.. Can only be forwarded by the firewall
.. Uses Layer 2 traffic
.. Can be in a different subnet than the interface
.. Cannot respond to pings
..
.. Other
.. Can only be forwarded by the firewall
.. Can be in a different subnet than the interface
.. Cannot respond to pings
.. IP Alias
.. 
.. New to pfSense 2.0
.. Can be used or forwarded by the firewall
.. Allows extra IP addresses to be added to an interface

.. you dont have to memorize them all. when you need just come here
.. see for a while.

... here we configure the virtual ip address 

.. configuring the proxyarp virtual ip address.
.. in firewall/virtual ip and type is proxyarp. 
.. interface:lan2 where the request coming to.
.. address: the virtual ip we just configured as proxyarp.
.. and save and apply.

.. then configuration firewall/nat 1:1 natting where we will put our just
.. configured virtual ip (proxyarp). 

.. interface: lan2
.. external ip: 192.168.10.123 why this one is external? because all 
.. our request will come to this interface and finally be redirected 
.. to internal ip
.. internal ip: 192.168.244.147 (this is most crucial here because we 
.. we have to configure it accordingly otherwise this will fail. 
.. we are using our internal ip address as the incoming request at lan2 
.. will go to internal address). 
.. nat reflection: use system default

.. and finally we have to allow the incoming packets to its destination
.. in firewall/rule. we do it like firewall/rule/lan2 and clicking 
.. related log up right corner and allow it just clicking the plus sign.

.. and now browse http://192.168.10.123 and ssh root@192.168.10.123 from
.. user host(say kali 192.168.10.1).it will redirect the traffic from 
.. 192.168.10.123 to 192.168.244.147. 

... outbound nat

.. say we are now dealing with a problem like say one server located at
.. dmz site has two interfaces lan2 and dmz1. when it receive the http
.. request to server on its dmz1 interface its serves back by its dmz1 
.. interface but problem it is when we try
.. to connect the server with ssh(22) port then it goes by its lan interface 
.. but try to come back by dmz1 interface which is eventually timed out.
.. we can solve this kind of problem with outbound nat rule.

.. as our server has two interface lan2 and dmz1. so we configure like 
.. below. firewall/nat/outbound 
.. interface: lan2
.. protocol: tcp
.. source: any
.. destination: network and 192.168.244.147 port 22 ( this is the server
.. ip where the request will be passed). 
.. translation address: interface address (this is the interesting point
.. here. as we want return traffic should come from lan2 interface not from 
.. dmz1. incoming request come to lan2 and its ok and we want return traffic
.. should come from lan2 not from dmz1)

... gateway/static route

.. we can configure the gateway and static route from system/routing.
.. and all the settings are self explanatory.

... captive portal 

.. this is the most internesting things. we do that by service/captive
.. portal. and all the things are self explanatory. and when we try to 
.. connect by browser pfsense will show portal for the authentication.

.. and we capture the request from radius server like below

root@deb-7:~# tcpdump -i eth1 -n -n -v -v port 1812
tcpdump: listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
