............................ few about openvswitch .........................

.. first we check our openvswitch version installed using following.

root@mininet-vm:~# ovs-appctl version
ovs-vswitchd (Open vSwitch) 2.0.2
Compiled Dec  9 2015 14:08:17
root@mininet-vm:~#

 The OVS as several components:

 ovsdb-server: A lightweight database server that provides switch level information (for example, information about switch ports).
 ovs-vswitchd: It is the core system component, which stores OpenFlow rules and performs flow based switching along with a compani
 on Linux kernel module.
 openvswitch_mod.ko: It is a Linux kernel module doing most of the flow-based switching in PicOS OVS mode. This module is not
 loaded in the PicOS accelerated OVS, and is replaced by the ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) for packet forwarding.
 CLI: The CLI (command-line interface) is used to control and manipulate other OVS components.
 The following three commands are used to control and monitor OVS:
 ovs-vsctl Commands: ovs-vsctl commands are used to control the ovsdb-server to create bridges, add interfaces, and configure
 interfaces.
 ovs-appctl Commands: ovs-appctl commands are used to control the ovs-vswitchd.
 ovs-ofctl Commands: ovs-ofctl commands are used to send OpenFlow queries. This can be used to manipulate the flows in ovs-
 vswitchd.
 Each of those commands have a man page that can be viewed from the Linux shell on your PicOS switch.

.. some of ovs related command below.

root@mininet-vm:~# ovs-ofctl show s1

  2: table2  : wild=0x3fffff, max=1000000, active=0
               lookup=0, matched=0

// output cut //

.. when we need to confiruge vswitch remotely we do like below.

root@dev-42:~# ovs-vsctl --db=tcp:<remote ip host>:6640 add-br br0
root@dev-42:~# ovs-vsctl --db=tcp:<remote ip host>:6640 add-port br0 eth2 vlan_mode=trunk tag=1

.. the above line instruct that eth2 port will be our trunk port. another options
.. is the access mode like below.

root@dev-42:~# ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth2 vlan_mode=access tag=1
