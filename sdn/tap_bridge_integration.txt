... after creating a bridge we will add that bridge to
... one of the physical interace of the system. 
... in our instance we are adding this to one of our 
... tap interface. we will do the bridging

... by scripting
... placing the following code in /etc/network/interface

└──╼ # cat interfaces
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface tap0 inet manual
    pre-up ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap user root
    pre-up ip addr add 192.168.121.1/24 dev tap0
    up ip link set dev tap0 up

auto vswitch01
iface vswitch01 inet manual
   bridge-ports tap0 
   bridge_stp off
#  bridge_fd 9
#  bridge_hello 2
#  bridge_maxage 12

... note below out virtual switchis vswitch01 and how we 
... bridging together.

... manually
... another way to add interfacw with the bridge is following 
... adding interface tap1 in vswitch01 manually by following

└──╼ # ovs-vsctl add-port vswitch01 tap0

└──╼ # ovs-vsctl show
493f1272-96d6-4128-a99b-956fec8cbed4
    Bridge "vswitch01"
        Port "tap1"
            Interface "tap1"
        Port "tap0"
            Interface "tap0"
        Port "vswitch01"
            Interface "vswitch01"
                type: internal
    ovs_version: "2.5.4"
┌─[root@elxabl1vvp2]─[/etc/network]
└──╼ 

... finally restart networking..
