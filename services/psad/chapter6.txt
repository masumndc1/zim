// note here that the log is showing that the scanning is coming from 192.168.35.1 and 1-63331 ports have been scanned and due

// danger level of 5 with only 369 packets? because i have put 192.168.25.1 in the auto_dl packet to show that
// if scanning coming from this ip on port 22 ie ssh will be market as danger level 5
// portion of the auto_dl file is given below.

// 192.168.35.0/24    5    tcp/22;   # Assign danger level 5 if protocol is tcp and port is 22

// and now the danger level is 4 as to be 4 number of packet needed to be over 1500.
