... the various user role available in the selinux are.
... user_r, staff_r, sysadm_r, system_r, unconfined_r

... selinux user end with the _u naming convention. these users
... can not be changed.
... for instance for sysadm_r role there is a sysadm_u user.

... sensitivity level.
... this part is made of confidentiality level, s part and category value, c part.
... selinux put the number in the s part, starting from 0.

... policy: selinux policy changing requires the system level reboot.

... what will be the policy on the next reboot can be found in the

[root@suricata ~]# cat /etc/selinux/config | grep -i selinuxtype
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
[root@suricata ~]#

... The most common SELinux policy store names are strict , targeted , mcs , and mls.

[root@suricata ~]# sestatus  | grep -i mls
Policy MLS status:              enabled
[root@suricata ~]#

... if MLS is disabled then the forth field in the selinux context will not be present.

... another way to check the file content of the following.

[root@suricata ~]# cat /sys/fs/selinux/mls
1
[root@suricata ~]#

... to see what selinux will do something unknown permission.

root@suricata ~]# sestatus | grep -i deny_unknown
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
[root@suricata ~]#

... Administrators can set this for themselves in the /etc/selinux/semanage.conf file
... through the handle-unknown key (with allow, deny, or reject).

... to check any unconfined domain present in the system is

[root@suricata selinux]# yum install -y setools-console

[root@suricata selinux]# seinfo

... Most distributions that enable unconfined domains call their policy targeted ,
... but this is just a convention that is not always followed. Hence, it is always best
... to consult the policy using seinfo to make this sure.

... when a policy only support one single sensitivity then we say it MCS(multi category
... security) policy. this provides on sensitivity but allow multiple category.

... the policy file that used by selinux at boot time can be found in the targeted folder
... as this is policy currently using. if strict was the policy will be used then that
... too can be found in the strict directory.

[root@suricata policy]# pwd

[root@suricata policy]# ls

[root@suricata policy]#

... if there is multiple policy file then we can see from the seinfo output which
... one will be used.

... modules can be found in the targeted directory. also when new modules are added,
... system calls the semodule to load the module.
... and its then combine the policy into the single file and we find our new policy file.
