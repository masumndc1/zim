[root@localhost masum]# grep -i selinux /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
SELINUXTYPE=targeted

... in our settings the selinux is in enforcing state.
... the other states are permissive and disabled.
... in our settings the policy is targeted.

... in permissive state any violation will be logged and reported and
... it will not impose any policy on the system.

... in enforcing state selinux will enforce its policy and
... block according to its policy. violation will be reported and
... action will be blocked.

[root@localhost masum]# sestatus | grep mode
Current mode:                   enforcing

... if we change the state to disable then we need to change the label too.
... thats why its always better to switch between permissive and enforcing.

... we change the states permanently using SELINUX field in /etc/selinux/config
... file and rebooting the system.

... switching among states temporarily.

... [root@localhost masum]# setenforce 0 ; to permissive state of the selinux
... [root@localhost masum]# setenforce 1 ; to enforcing state of the selinux
...

... disabling selinux for the single service.
... to list which domain/services are now permissive by default we can run


[root@localhost masum]# semanage permissive -l

... and to see full list of services are now under control of selinux we can run

[root@localhost masum]# ps -eZ

...
... from this list, if we need, can exclude any domain out of selinux control to
... run as if, it is running on a selinux disabled system.
... for example one service minildna_t .

... we check it by seeing weather any services linked with libselinux
... the application which is selinux aware can change the behaviour
... knowing any application is selinux aware helps to troubleshoot them
