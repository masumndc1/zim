# the line that start with # is the comment. be careful
# dont be fool with the line start with #
# this is the step by step transparent proxy configuration for
# fedora and red hat enterprise linux 5.
# change the setting accordingly to your own configuration.
# dont be confused to type as follows your configuration will be different.

[root@localhost etc]#

# user : root
# ur hostname : localhost
# ur current directory : etc

# user as root at the hostname of the computer localhost and you
# are at the etc directory.

# for the further help go to
# www.linuxhomenetworking.com
# or the book linux bible..
# here you will need some iptables firewall
# to have go to the www.linuxhomenetworking.com


[root@localhost etc]#vi /etc/hostname

192.168.1.1 khabir.localdomain  khabir


[root@localhost etc]#vi /etc/squid/squid.conf

# dont be fool enough to change this according to your
# need and the according place at the /etc/squid/squid.conf file
# this following change at any where will work but it is good practise to
# have this change according to the appropiate portion of the file.


visible_hostname khabir
http_port 3128 transparent
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/29
http_access allow localnet

cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 4100 16 256
cache_mem 128 MB


# the following lines are optional

cache_store_log /var/log/store/store.log
cache_mgr sourov@yahoo.com

# suppose you want to restrict browsing by the time and day
# of the week.

acl busineeshour time S M T W T F 9:00-17:00
http_access allow localnet busineeshour

# now create the swap space by the following command

[root@localhost etc]#squid -z


# restriction the web site

[root@localhost etc]#touch /usr/local/etc/restrictedsite.squid
[root@localhost etc]#chmod 755 /usr/local/etc/restrictedsite.squid
[root@localhost etc]#vi /usr/local/etc/restrictedsite.squid

# write one website per line.

:x!

[root@localhost etc]#vi /etc/squid/squid.conf

acl badsite dstdomain "/usr/local/etc/restrictedsite.squid"
http_access deny badsite localnet busineeshour

# the above lines means these site will not be available
# at the time 9:00 morning to 17:00 evening at the week
# sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday and friday.
# other time they will be accessible.

# to do some check browse from a LAN side computer using the
# and at the same time at ur proxy server check it is working or not.

[root@localhost etc]#tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log

# by the command u will see lot of line while browsing like
# TCP_MISS OR TCP_HIT


# now go to the www.linuxhomenetworking.com
# for the iptables firewal for transparent proxy.

# you may need ip forwarding One way to allow this is to change the value of net.ipv4.ip_forward to 1
#in the /etc/sysctl.conf file. Open that file as root user with any text editor and
#change the line to appear as follows:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

# if you are using modem then you have various ip each time you connect
the modem then you need following MASQUERADE  rules.
#Here is an example of a MASQUERADE rule:
root@localhost# iptables –t nat –A POSTROUTING –o ppp0 –j MASQUERADE

# if you are having fixed ip from ISP then you need following SNAT rules.
# Use either MASQUERADE or SNAT rules based on you configuration but not both.

#Here is an example of a SNAT rule:
root@localhost# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 12.12.12.12

# transparent proxy
#The following is an example of a set of command-line options to the iptables command
that causes a request for Web service (port 80) to be directed to a proxy service (port 3128):
root@localhost# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128


# If this document is not clear to u
# communicate with
# or  01190 676840
# or if both number is not availabe then
# @ 01717 614976
