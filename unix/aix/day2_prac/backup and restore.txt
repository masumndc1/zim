			Backup and restore

----Create a vg

#mkvg -s 16 -y anjvg1 hdisk2

----To create another filesystem with mount pount point

#crfs -v jfs2 -g anjvg1 -a size=32M  -m /fs2

#mount /fs2

#df -m

#touch /fs2/file1

#touch /fs2/file2

----To take the backup of a vg into amother vg's file

#mkdir /tmp/anjan

#savevg -f /tmp/anjan/bkup -i anjvg1

To delete the vg

#umount /fs2

#reducevg -df anjvg1 hdisk2

To view the vg
#lsvg

To restore the vg
# restvg -q -f /tmp/anjan/bkup hdisk2

To check the proper restore
#lsvg -l anjvg1
#ls /fs2


























****By the above command the sapvg is restored and the pvs are mounted automatically


To view the information about the backup and restore of the sapvg are in


#ls -l /tmp/vgdata


# cat /tmp/vgdata/sapvg/sapvg.data

























To backup the files in the filesystem

create a file

mkdir /m1
cat>/m1/f1

cat>/m1/f2


cat>lf
/m1/f1
/m1/f2
save it

Then give the command
# backup -iqvf anj<lf
****the files in lf are backed up in anj file.
 or
#smit backfile

rm -rf /m1

To view the files which are backed up
# restore -Tvf anj

To restore the file in their original directory
# restore -xvf anj

ls /m1

To take a selective restore
#restore -xvf anj /m1/f2
****here only file anjan will be restored,i.e selective restore

for incremental backup use

smit backfilesys


#backup -f /anjan/bkp -0
