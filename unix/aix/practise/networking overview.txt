To stop or start the ftp or telnet service

You can disable any service in /etc/inetd.conf file

vi /etc/inetd.conf
For example
modify the 'ftp service ' line from:

ftp stream tcp6 nowait root /usr/sbin/ftpd ftpd

to

#ftp stream tcp6 nowait root /usr/sbin/ftpd ftpd

and don't forget about restart the inetd

#refresh -s inetd

or
#startsrc -t ftp
#stopsrc -t ftp

To configure the rexecd service in aix 5.3

1. check in the /etc/hosts file, make sure the PC's IP address and name is
in the host file.
2. Edit the /etc/inetd.conf file, change the line which says:
exec stream tcp nowait root /etc/rexecd rexecd
to:
exec stream tcp nowait root /etc/rexecd rexecd -c

This switch disables the reverse name lookup.

3. #refresh -s inetd

4. Create the file: etc/netsvc.conf
This file should just contain one line which is:

hosts=local,bind

This file allows the host to read the machine location information from the
etc/host file.

Now from windows
c:\>rexec 192.168.0.250 uname
type username and password
the command will execute
