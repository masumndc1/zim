... package management in arch linux

... if we need to install packages from source like freebsd port source
... we can do that by using ABS. to do so, we need to install the ABS
... along with base-devel.

... we can also install packages from AUS, arch user repository which
... is similar to ubuntu ppa. to install packages from aur we need to
... install base-devel first.

... using the makepkg: is a tool to use for package buildup. this is the
... way when we build tool from ABS or AUR. we run the commake makepkg
... from the directory where PKGBUILD resides.

... full system upgrade we do by folloing
... pacman -Syu

... install a package
