... doas, sudo alternative

pkg install doas

$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
permit nopass keepenv masum as root
$ 

... if you need to give privilege to run a single command 
... to an user do following.

$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf 
permit nopass keepenv masum cmd shutdown
$ 

... you can combine both of them as follows.

$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
permit nopass keepenv masum as root
permit nopass keepenv masum cmd shutdown
$ 

... nopass: no asking user masum for pass
... persist: to keep session for a while
... keepenv: user environment will be kept
... masum: as user
... as root: masum will be given right as root.

... then we can run any command as root

$ doas pkg install htop
