pkg install doas

$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf 
permit nopass keepenv masum as root
$ 

... nopass: no asking user masum for pass
... persist: to keep session for a while
... keepenv: user environment will be kept
... masum: as user
... as root: masum will be given right as root.

$ doas pkg install htop
