  if you have external monitor and you need to add them,
then do following. I have two monitors, both of them added by
adding following lines in following file.

1. Install the drm-kmod package
$ sudo pkg install drm-kmod

2. Add this to your /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf.d/radeon file:
kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko"

Ensure that your UID is a member of the "video" group.

3. Restart your system; you should see the radeonkms.ko get loaded
and a flash on your console as we switch over to the new display driver.

4. Start Xorg via your usual method (i.e. startx, GDM, etc.)

5. Add following in /boot/loader.conf to two display working.
i915kms_load="YES"

6. I might had to install xrandr and arandr
$ sudo pkg install xrandr arandr

I have found this had worked.
