........................ jail configuration in freebsd .....................

... at first we are creating the home directory and jail's hostname.

root@masum:/usr # export D=/usr/jails/khabir
export: Command not found.

... that means we are not using the bourne shell.
... instead may be we are using C shell or its variants.

root@masum:/usr # setenv D /usr/jails/khabir
root@masum:/usr # 

... here khabir will be jail servers home directory name as well as
... hostname of the jail server.
... now we will build the jail for us. any typo will lead to a broken
... host system

... this command may take some time to finish. if we have one machince
... previously made then we can skip "make buildworld" to save our time.
... to make one new jail we can do the following

# setenv D /usr/jails/anotherjail
# mkdir –p $D
# cd /usr/src
# make installworld DESTDIR=$D
# make distribution DESTDIR=$D

... now mount the devfs of jail like below.

# mount –t devfs devfs $D/dev
