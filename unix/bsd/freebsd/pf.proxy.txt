... say we want to implement the transparent proxy in BSD.
... then we need to divert one port to another port on locat pc.

... port diversion has following syntax

pass in inet proto tcp from lan:network to any port 80 divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 3129

... on BSD the squid servers works on 3129 can be installed from
... ports from /usr/ports/www/squid.

... the rule has the human readable easy syntax like any packets 
... destined to 80 port from lan following through BSD firewall
... will be divert to 3129 port on firewall machine itself.
... on that port squid chaching proxy server is working.
