... we have to reboot the computer and stop to load the current kernel
... To load the previous kernel, you should stop the system from booting the current
... kernel by choosing the Escape to loader prompt from the loader menu during the
... boot up process. Once the loader prompt appears, you should unload the existing
... modules and load the previous kernel, and then continue the boot process:

# unload
# load /boot/kernel.old/kernel
# boot
