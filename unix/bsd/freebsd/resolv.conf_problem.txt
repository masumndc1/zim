..
.. on freebsd we have found the problem which is
.. automatically change of content in /etc/resolv.conf
.. to make it permanent we did that following.

root@masum:~ # cd /etc
root@masum:/etc # cat dhclient.conf
# $FreeBSD: releng/11.0/etc/dhclient.conf 85575 2001-10-27 03:14:37Z rwatson $
#
#	This file is required by the ISC DHCP client.
#	See ``man 5 dhclient.conf'' for details.
#
#	In most cases an empty file is sufficient for most people as the
#	defaults are usually fine.
#
prepend domain-name-servers 4.2.2.1;
supersed domain-name-servers 4.2.2.1;
root@masum:/etc #
root@masum:/etc # cat resolv.conf
# Generated by resolvconf
search localdomain
nameserver 4.2.2.1
nameserver 192.168.35.2

root@masum:/etc #

.. now everytime we reboot our machine or change ip address
.. nameserver 4.2.2.1 will not change.
