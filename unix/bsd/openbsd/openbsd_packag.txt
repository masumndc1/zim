 An example /etc/installurl might look like this:

    https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD


or

 Multiple mirrors can be specified in the PKG_PATH environment variable, separated by colons:

    # export PKG_PATH=scp://user@company-build-server/usr/ports/packages/%a/all:https://trusted-public-server/%m:installpath

after setting any of them we can run

pkg_add to install packages
