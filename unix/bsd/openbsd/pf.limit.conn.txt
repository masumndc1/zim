........................... limit connection ..........................

.. our sample pf configuration is like below.

-bash-4.3#
-bash-4.3# cat -n pf.conf

    31  table <bruteforce> persist
    32
    34  block quick from <bruteforce>
    37
    44  pass log (all) proto tcp to port $client_services label "pass in" \
    45  keep state ( max-src-conn 100, max-src-conn-rate 15/5, overload <bruteforce> \
    46  flush global)
    47
-bash-4.3#

.. on line 31 we define a new table bruteforce.
.. on line 34 our blocking rule will block every ip from brutefore table.
.. on line 44 we are saying maximum source connection will be 100,
.. maximum connection per 5seconds will be 15. if any host ip cross this
.. limit will be overloaded to bruteforce table and all the conncetion will
.. be flushed. and this ip will be include permanently to bruteforce table.
.. this bruteforce table will be persist after the pf configuration reload.

.. other options related to keep state are below.

    35  match in on $ext_if proto tcp to port { www, https } rdr-to <webserver> round-robin
    36  pass on $ext_if proto tcp to port { www, https } \
    37  keep state ( max 1500, max-src-conn 500 )

.. here we are controlling the max state 1500 and maximum connection is 500 to our
.. webserver load balancer. this rule is saying after redirection of web traffic
.. the maximum state will be not more than 1500 and max connection will be 500
.. from a host.

-bash-4.3# pfctl -d
pf disabled
-bash-4.3# pfctl -evf /etc/pf.conf

... tableshooting.

table <webserver> persist { 192.168.244.132 192.168.244.147 }
udp_services = "{ domain, ntp }"
client_services = "{ ftp, ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, https, pop3s }"
table <bruteforce> persist

.. mistakenly keep placed with match keyword but it should be with
.. pass rules. this is showing by the following.

/etc/pf.conf:36: keep state is great, but only for pass rules
/etc/pf.conf:36: skipping rule due to errors
/etc/pf.conf:36: keep state is great, but only for pass rules
/etc/pf.conf:36: skipping rule due to errors
/etc/pf.conf:36: rule expands to no valid combination
pfctl: Syntax error in config file: pf rules not loaded
-bash-4.3#

.. following command will flush the statistics of the table bruteforce
.. after 86400 second. in other way which is 86400s old.

-bash-4.3# pfctl -t bruteforce -T expire 86400
