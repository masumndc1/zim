... Bastion host
... Bastion host is useful when we need to connect to number of our internal
... servers from internet through that bastion host.
... Bastion host just works like a jumphost.
... Bastion host itself normally has limited port open. Only required services
... are run in an bastion host to limit attackers hack the bastion host as 
... well as internal systems. 

... More info can be found on bastion host on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host

... We will use bastion host, so that through the bastion host we can connect
... to our internal servers. 
... It has couple of advantages. first one is, it saves the floating ip address.
... internal server does not need floating ip address to connect to them.

... Here in this document, we will use proxycommand option of openssh to 
... connect our internal servers through bastion server.

... first of all, we need netcat installed in our bastion server.
... On rpm based system we can install nc by
 
$ sudo yum install -y nc

... On the other hand, on deb based systems (debian, ubuntu) we can do following.

$ sudo apt-get install -y nc

... Once, nc is installed, we need a ssh config file, which openssh client 
... will use when connecting to remote servers through bastion host. 
... An example of a fictitious ssh.config file can be following. 

Host internal_server1
HostName 192.168.1.33
User internal_user1
ProxyCommand ssh -q user@bashtion.example.com nc %h %p

Host internal_server2
HostName 192.168.1.48
User internal_user2
ProxyCommand ssh -q user@bashtion.example.com nc %h %p

... Explanation of the each options.
... Host: is the keyword.
... internal_server1: is a user defined name. This name we will use when we ssh to the
... internal server.
... HostName: either ip or fully qualified domain name of the internal server.
... User: the user of the internal server.
... In the ProxyCommand line user is the user of bashtion.example.com, bashion host.
... nc is the netcat command and %h is host of internal server and %p is port.

... Now we can use following command to connect internal servers through bastion host
... by following way. 

$ ssh -F ssh.config internal_server1
[internal_user1@internal_server1 ~]$

... Similarly, to connect to the second server.

$ ssh -F ssh.config internal_server2
[internal_user2@internal_server2 ~]$

... And this way, we can ssh other system in the internal network, just we need to edit 
... ssh.config file and add the internal systems information there.
 
... Accessing web-pages through bastion host.
... We will use two methods to access webpages through the bastion host.

... 1. ssh local port forwarding.
... We can use ssh local port forwarding technique to access web pages through bastion
... host. To do that, we need to do following on local machine.

$ ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 -F ssh.config internal_server1

... Then we need to browse http:localhost:8080 in our browser which will go through
... bastion host to destination, internal_server1.

... 2. ssh dynamic port forwarding.
... To use dynamic port forwarding we need to use socks proxy server.
... We will make our bastion host to accept port forwarding. Any port forwarding 
... through bastion will be forwarded to destination host.

... In the local machines, we run following.

$ ssh -D 1080 bastion.example.com

... Now we have to configure our browser's proxy setting. In firefox,
... We will tick Manual proxy configuration. We will only put "localhost"
... in the SOCKS Host field and port 1080. We will not touch any other field.
... We need also set Firefox to use the DNS through that proxy, so even our DNS ... lookups are secure:

... Type in about:config in the Firefox address bar
... Find the key called "network.proxy.socks_remote_dns" and set it to true
... 
... The SOCKS proxy will stop working when we close our SSH session. We will need to change 
... these settings back to normal in order for Firefox to work again.
... To make other programs use our SSH proxy server, we will need to configure each program in a similar way.

... Now we can browse http://internal_server1 in our browser.

... This way we can access all of our internal host and browse all of our
... internal webservers.
