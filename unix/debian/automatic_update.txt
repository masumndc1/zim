root@ipaclient:/etc/apt/apt.conf.d# cat 50unattended-upgrades | grep -v -e ^//
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
       // "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}";

        // should also install from here by default.
        // "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}";
};

... rebooting if needed
Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";

... rebooting on 2.00 at night
Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-Time "02:00";

root@ipaclient:/etc/apt/apt.conf.d# 

... also make following changes in the following files
... /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades

# cat 20auto-upgrades 
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
# 

... now modify the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic similar to:

APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";

... This will run automatic unattended security upgrades, once per day.
... Now, if needed to run manually: sudo unattended-upgrade.
