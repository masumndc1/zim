Try doing this in terminal

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade #see if the package is held back
sudo apt-get purge gnome-session
sudo apt-get install gnome-session
startx

first of all sudo apt-get purge gnome-session.

after all purging the gnome session make sure to clear packages by using bellow command sudo apt-get autoremove sudo apt-get autoclean

and than sudo apt-get install gnome-session it will work most the time when tasksel fail to install gnome.

i have tested this code on debian jessie and ubuntu lts 14.04.

i have this kind of crazy issue once i have messed up with gtk or multiple session at a time So also.

this will help you out form the session issue.

After upgrading from Squeeze to Wheezy a virtual machine running on KVM, I had to install "gnome-session-falback" in order to open successfully a session in gnome:

sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback

You will need to install aptitude and tasksel before install gnome

Aptitude is an Ncurses based FrontEnd to Apt, the debian package manager.

Tasksel is a tool that installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated “task” onto your system.

# apt-get install aptitude tasksel

Install gnome on debian

# tasksel install gnome-desktop --new-install

Solution Seven: switch to a basic graphics driver

Many graphics problems, blank screens and desktop loading issues are caused by misconfigured, corrupt or buggy graphics drivers. Propriety graphics drivers such as those used by ATI and NVIDIA graphics cards can be especially troublesome.

The easiest way to fix a bad VGA driver is to disable the driver and to use a generic driver such as MESA or VESA. This can be done by recreating the xorg.conf file:

    Drop to a shell
    Stop your display manager as shown in table 1 of this guide e.g “sudo stop kdm” or “sudo stop gdm”
    Delete your xorg.conf file
    PHP
    sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    1
    	
    sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    Paying attention to the capital X, recreate a default xorg.conf file with
    PHP
    sudo Xorg -configure
    1
    	
    sudo Xorg -configure
    The new xorg.conf file will be in your home directory. Move it to /etc/X11/ with
    PHP
    sudo mv ~/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    1
    	
    sudo mv ~/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    Restart your display manager with “sudo start kdm” or “sudo start gdm” etc…
    Access the graphical environment with Ctrl+Alt+F7

xorg.conf stores configuration settings for your display driver. Running the Xorg -configure command causes Xorg to create an xorg.conf file that specifies the use of a generic graphics driver.

Once a generic driver is in use you should be able to load your desktop and install the propriety driver again. Hope that doing so fixes the original issue; if it does not you will need to reset to the generic MESA or VESA driver. If creating a new xorg.conf file does not fix your desktop then you will at least know that your desktop loading error is not necessarily related to your graphics driver.
Solution Eight: reinstall your desktop manager or install a new one

This could take some time because your computer might need to download a lot of software packages.

To reinstall your desktop manager, choose the appropriate installation command for your distro from this list:

Ubuntu
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep ubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep ubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop

Kubuntu
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep kubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall kubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep kubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall kubuntu-desktop

Lubuntu
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep lubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall lubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep lubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall lubuntu-desktop

Xubuntu
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep xubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall xubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep xubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall xubuntu-desktop

Edubuntu
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep edubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall edubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep edubuntu-desktop
sudo aptitude reinstall edubuntu-desktop

The good news here is that you can install multiple desktop environments into Linux and Linux will love you for it.

Installing an alternative desktop environment will provide you with a desktop to use until your regular one is fixed. To install a new desktop environment, use the above commands but replace sudo aptitude reinstall with apt-get install.

For example, if you use Ubuntu you can install Kubuntu along side Ubuntu with:
PHP
sudo apt-get build-dep kubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
1
2
	
sudo apt-get build-dep kubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

An alternative way to install a new desktop environment is to use Tasksel. Install Tasksel with “sudo apt-get install tasksel” then run it from the command line with “sudo tasksel”. Once Tasksel is loaded, use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the software packages, use the space bar to select packages and use the enter key to commit changes.

Solution Nine: reconfigure everything

If you are adamant that you want your desktop fixed because you can’t live life without it then a completely nuclear approach is to reconfigure everything. In this case, “everything” does mean every single bit of software installed on your computer via its package manager.

Reconfiguration is achieved with
PHP
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a --priority=critical
1
	
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a --priority=critical

The option –priority=critical instructs DPKG to show questions that absolutely must be answered by a human to enable a package to be configured. Keep watching the shell because you will need to answer occasional questions that must be answered before DPKG can continue processing software.

A common error chucked out by dpkg while everything is being reconfigured is
PHP
dpkg-maintscript-helper: error: couldn't identify the package
1
	
dpkg-maintscript-helper: error: couldn't identify the package

The solution is to run the following sed command to comment out any lines beginning “dpkg-maintscript-helper”. These lines are found in all cron files stored in /var/lib/dpkg/info/
PHP
sudo sed -ir 's/^\(dpkg-maintscript-helper\)/#\1/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/cron.*
1
	
sudo sed -ir 's/^\(dpkg-maintscript-helper\)/#\1/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/cron.*

After DPKG has reconfigured everything, uncomment those lines with the sed command
PHP
sudo sed -ir 's/^#dpkg-maintscript-helper/dpkg-maintscript-helper/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/cron.*
1
	
sudo sed -ir 's/^#dpkg-maintscript-helper/dpkg-maintscript-helper/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/cron.*

If reconfiguring everything does not enable you to gain access to a desktop and none of the other solutions presented in this guide to fixing desktop loading errors revives your desktop then I suggest you use a Live Disc to access your hard drive then backup your home directory and any files you want to keep then reinstall your OS. Alternatively, keep searching for solutions and post them here so we can all benefit from them.

GDM in Gnome 3.6


"apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade"

to install missing files Let's check the Network connectivity by following steps

Service networking start Service Network-manager start Service samba start dhclient eth0

(ifconfig to check the net interface configuration is ok and eth0 is working right)

Then Update and Upgrade the kali..

Next install "chkconfig" if its not installed through

"apt-get install chkconfig"

Then check the status of level 2 of gdm3 using

"chkconfig --level 2 gdm3"

Install gdm3 service if it's not installed when i typed gdm3 it showed me "bash: gdm3:command not found" then i typed sudo

"apt-get install gdm3"

after installing i just typed

gdm3

in the terminal. Then it directly taken me to the graphical mode..

http://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/01/28/revert-kali-linux-login-classic-backtrack-command-line-login/


dpkg-reconfigure gdm3 


i had the same problem.. fixed it in these steps
type the following commands in terminal as root
1.
Code:

#apt-get update

2.
Code:

#apt-get install xorg

3.
Code:

#startx
