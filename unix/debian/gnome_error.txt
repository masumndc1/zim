if gnome broken after kali or other type update
then we can do the following.

1. try to install xorg

# apt-get install xorg

2. try to install gnome-session purging the previous

# apt-get purge gnome-session
# apt-get install gnome-session

# startx

3. if not solve then try to install another x-window
manager like lightdm which will then prompt you
to choose which x-window manager to use gdm3 or
lightdm. choose lightdm instead as gdm3 is not working.

# apt-get install lightdm

4. now we can use another x-window manage like xfce4 or
lxde like below.

# apt-get install xfce4

or

# apt-get install lxde

and then try to load x-window manager. if it is ok then
try to isntall full environment like

# apt-get install task-lxde-desktop

or

# apt-get install task-xfce-desktop


# if you have time try to install kde hope
# this will solve the issue.


# apt-get install task-kde-desktop
