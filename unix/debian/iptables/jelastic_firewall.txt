... at first we have to check that /etc/jelastic/metainf.conf file and find the
FIREWALL_ENABLED=1 parameter:

... =1 is telling us the firewall is enabled.

... putting the iptables rules inside the /etc/sysconfig/iptables-custom file and save.

vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables-custom

*filter
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-I INPUT -s 111.111.111.111 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 1111 -j DROP
COMMIT
#

... apply the rules

sudo /usr/bin/jem firewall fwstart

... to check the applied rule. other options are

sudo /usr/bin/jem firewall list [ filter | nat | mangle ] {iptables_options}

sudo /usr/bin/jem firewall list filter -vn

... the rules at upper position have the higher priority than lower. therefore
... we can put our rule into position, based on our requirement.
