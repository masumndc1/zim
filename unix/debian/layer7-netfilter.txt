Testing

Let assume that you have a Ubuntu server with two network devices with WAN device eth0 and LAN device eth1. With iptables we redirect forwarded packages to the userspace.

**[// As for the testing purpose we will do ssh to our own maching so we are using OUTPUT chain. but we can use all the INPUT FORWARD chain too...]**

root@mail:~#iptables -A OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

Create a l7 config file in your favorite editor

root@mail:~# vi /etc/l7_filter.conf

and add some protocols

ssh 5
bittorrent 6

The list of all supported protocols can be found here. From the config we can read that l7 filter will assign the mark 5 to the packets of ssh protocol and it will sign with mark 6 the bittorrent packets.

Start l7 filter in debuging mode

root@mail:/etc# l7-filter -vv -f /etc/l7_filter.conf

                      ***WARNING***
Neither the ip_conntrack_netlink nor nf_conntrack_netlink kernel
modules are loaded. Unless these features are compiled into your
kernel, please load one and run l7-filter again.

On your LAN client run a bittorrent session or make an ssh connection to an external server. If everything goes fine l7-filter will recognize your traffic and inform you trough the standard output.
