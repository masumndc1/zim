Disk /dev/sda: 8589 MB, 8589934592 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1044 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table

bash-4.2# 
bash-4.2# fdisk  
BusyBox v1.21.0 (2013-05-27 12:32:57 MST) multi-call binary.

Usage: fdisk [-ul] [-C CYLINDERS] [-H HEADS] [-S SECTORS] [-b SSZ] DISK

Change partition table

	-u		Start and End are in sectors (instead of cylinders)
	-l		Show partition table for each DISK, then exit
	-b 2048		(for certain MO disks) use 2048-byte sectors
	-C CYLINDERS	Set number of cylinders/heads/sectors
	-H HEADS
	-S SECTORS

bash-4.2# fdisk /dev/sda
Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI, OSF or GPT disklabel
Building a new DOS disklabel. Changes will remain in memory only,
until you decide to write them. After that the previous content
won't be recoverable.


The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1044.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
