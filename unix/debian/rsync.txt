... rsync is a nice tool to remotely incremental syncing of file
... over internet. it can also work with ssh. one of the example
... can be like following. Say in the infrastructure directory
... you have ssh connection to the remote node through jumphost.
... then you issue command like:

~/github/infrastructure master
❯ rsync -avz ~/example -e "ssh -F ssh.config" masum@sys-deb12-dev1:/home/masum/

... another example to see the progress
~/github/infrastructure master
❯ rsync -avz -progress ~/example -e "ssh -F ssh.config" masum@sys-deb12-dev1:/home/masum/

... if you delete a file locally and want to delete the same file remotely.
~/github/infrastructure master
❯ rsync -avz --delete ~/example -e "ssh -F ssh.config" masum@sys-deb12-dev1:/home/masum/

...
... following way, I back up my usb drive.

❯ rsync -avz -progress --delete ~/Documents/whats/* /Volumes/masum_32gb
