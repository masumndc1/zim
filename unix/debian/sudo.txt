... No password for sudo
... Add yourself to the sudoers list so that you don't have
... to enter your password over and over again:

echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers

... also we can place a file bob with content like below in /etc/sudoers.d
bob ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
