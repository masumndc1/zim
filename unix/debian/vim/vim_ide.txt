... we can make vim easily an ide.
... to do so we need to install pathogen as well as
... pathogen made super easy to install plugins in vim.
... this is how we can install pathogen.
... full doc can be found in the following link
...

https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

... run following command in terminal

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim

... now put following lines at front in your .vimrc file.

vim ~/.vimrc
execute pathogen#infect()
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on

... Now any plugins you wish to install can be extracted to a subdirectory
... under ~/.vim/bundle, and they will be added to the 'runtimepath'.
... Observe: for example if you want to add vim-sensible with your vim just
... run following and restart vim.

cd ~/.vim/bundle && \
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git

... also please note that if plugins need python module, you need to install
... that by using pip.

... once we have install the pathogen. we need to install vundle
... another plugin manager for vim.

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

... now we will need one .vimrc file. one of the good vimrc file I have found
... from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amacgregor/dot-files/master/vimrc
... download it. this .vimrc file is nice for making vim as ide.

cp vimrc ~/.vimrc

... now run :PluginInstall in vim to download all the required plugins.
... And that will be all.

... error:
... we need to uninstall neocomplete, as this does not work with vim below 7.3
... remove vim-wakatime too from ~/.vim/bundle
... also remove vim-airline and vim-airlime-themes.
