... pathogen made super easy to install plugins in vim.
... this is how we can install pathogen.
... full doc can be found in the following link
...

https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

... run following command in terminal

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim

... now put following lines at front in your .vimrc file.

vim ~/.vimrc
execute pathogen#infect()
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on

... Now any plugins you wish to install can be extracted to a subdirectory 
... under ~/.vim/bundle, and they will be added to the 'runtimepath'. 
... Observe: for example if you want to add vim-sensible with your vim just 
... run following and restart vim.

cd ~/.vim/bundle && \
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git

... also please note that if plugins need python module, you need to install
... that by using pip.
