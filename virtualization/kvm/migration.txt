... v2v is the process used to convert vm in one environment to another environment.
... p2v is same when we need to convert all data from a physical server into virtual world.
... in another word p2v is something like converting one physical to virtual world.

... v2v we use to convert vms running on a virtual machine to run in kvm, openstack, ovirt
... and rhev (red hat enterprise virtualization). 

... virt-v2v can currently convert RHEL4, RHEL 5, RHEL 6, RHEL 7, Windows XP,
... Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008 virtual
... machines running on Xen, VMware ESX, and physical systems to KVM hypervisors.

... The following source hypervisors are currently supported by virt-v2v:
... libvirt-managed Xen
... VMware vSphere ESX/ESXiâ€”versions 3.5, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.5

... the virt-v2v utility performs the following steps:
... Retrieve guest configuration (xml) from the hypervisor
... Export a disk image
... Modify the disk image
... Create a guest on the target hypervisor

... guest operating system prerequisits:

... for linux
... the guest operating linux system kernel should have the virtio drivers. we can check 

[root@centos7 ~]# lsmod | grep virtio
virtio_balloon         13864  0 
virtio_blk             18156  3 
virtio_console         28066  0 
virtio_net             28096  0 
virtio_pci             22913  0 
virtio_ring            22746  5 virtio_blk,virtio_net,virtio_pci,virtio_balloon,virtio_console
virtio                 14959  5 virtio_blk,virtio_net,virtio_pci,virtio_balloon,virtio_console
[root@centos7 ~]# 

... for windows.

... Install the libguestfs-winsupport package on the host running
... virt-v2v. This package provides support for NTFS, which is used by many Windows systems.

... Install the virtio-win package on the host running virt-v2v. This
... package provides paravirtualized block and network drivers for Windows guests:

... Disable the Anti-Virus (AV) software if any installed, as in some
... circumstances it may prevent new drivers that virt-v2v installs from working.

... Disable Group Policy before doing the conversion, as in some
... circumstances it may prevent new drivers that virt-v2v installs, from working.


... Source hypervisor-specific prerequisites:
... KVM: Ensure that SSH is enabled and listening on the default port. Root
... login over SSH must be allowed. Make sure that the PermitRootLogin
... directive set to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config .

... VMware vSphere: Make sure that the following checklist is followed:
... Remove VMware-Tools installed on the system
... Enable SSH access to the system with permit root login
... virt-v2v directly talks to vCenter in order to perform the conversion,
... so you need either administrator-user credentials or a user with a
... custom non-administrator role, with a minimum set of permissions
... to access datastores and virtual machine configurations

... XEN Virtualization: The conversion guest must have access to the packages
... repository as new kernel and drivers need to be downloaded, and SSH should be enabled.

... after the conversion process done we can run the following command to define
... the virtual machine.

# virsh define /path/to/xml

... converting from ova to kvm.

root@elxa6lj5k72:/# virt-v2v -v -i ova -of qcow2 -os default OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps_VM_1.2.ova 

... but i have problem with it. so what i did is I extracted the ova with tar command and use
... the vmdk file into kvm as storage.
