... The software released for this stack is hosted in its own self contained
... repository on the CentOS mirror network. In order to enable this repository,
... ensure that the CentOS-Extras repo is enabled and type:

yum install centos-release-xen

... Xen needs a kernel built with "domain 0" support to operate. Xen4 provides
... an updated kernel; so the first thing to do is to run an update to pull the new kernel in:

yum update
yum install xen

... During Xen and the kernel installation, a script called grub-bootxen.sh should
... have been run which makes sure grub is updated (/boot/grub/grub.conf for CentOS 6
... /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for CentOS 7). For CentOS 6, if you look at your /boot/grub/grub.conf
... it should have something like this:


title CentOS (3.4.46-8.el6.centos.alt.x86_64)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /xen.gz dom0_mem=1024M,max:1024M loglvl=all guest_loglvl=all
        module /vmlinuz-3.4.46-8.el6.centos.alt.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_xen01-lv_root
	rd_LVM_LV=vg_xen01/lv_swap rd_NO_LUKS  KEYBOARDTYPE=pc KEYTABLE=uk rd_NO_MD LANG=en_GB
	rd_LVM_LV=vg_xen01/lv_root SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 crashkernel=auto rd_NO_DM rhgb quiet
        module /initramfs-3.4.46-8.el6.centos.alt.x86_64.img

... If this is not set to the default kernel, edit the file and set it now. Once you reboot,
... verify that the new kernel is running with:

uname -r
xl info
