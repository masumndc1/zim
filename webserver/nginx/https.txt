writing new private key to '/etc/ssl/nginx/private.key'

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:bd
State or Province Name (full name) []:dhaka
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:dhaka
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:masum inc
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:it
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:md khabir uddin
Email Address []:masum@gmail.com
[root@nginx nginx]# ls
cert.crt  private.key
[root@nginx nginx]#

... now placing these key's location to nginx configuration section.

    server {

        ssl_certificate "/etc/ssl/nginx/cert.crt";
        ssl_certificate_key "/etc/ssl/nginx/private.key";
}

... now reload the nginx server and browse https://<server_ip>
... which will give an error as this certificate is self-sign and
... not authorize by any CA.

[root@nginx nginx]# service nginx restart
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl restart  nginx.service
[root@nginx nginx]#

... generating csr(certificates sign request). csr will be send to any CA
... to give us public certificates. command is as follows

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/ssl/nginx/myprivate.key \
-out /etc/ssl/nginx/my.csr

... this above command will generate one my.csr which we will then send to any CA
... to authorize it and provide us the public certificates. after using that
... certificate browser will not generate any error.
... https://letsencrypt.org is a CA which gives free certificates.
