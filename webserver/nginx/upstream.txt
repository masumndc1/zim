... when nginx needs to pass traffic to others, say to php, nginx
... needs to know where those php workers live. in nginx terminology
... these workers are called upstream. nginx pass particular request
... to upstream and wait for the response from the upstream and upon
... getting the response it again delivers the response to requester.

... we have to define upstream up above the server tag in nginx.conf 
... file like the example below.

upstream php {
                server unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
}

server {

}

... that means any php request will be forwarded to corresponding sockets.
... to determine which socket or port is listening our php request we can issue 

[root@nginx php-fpm.d]# pwd
/etc/php-fpm.d
[root@nginx php-fpm.d]# ls
www.conf
[root@nginx php-fpm.d]# cat www.conf | grep "listen ="
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
[root@nginx php-fpm.d]# 

... in that case to pass php request with fastcgi_pass like below

location ~ *.php {
 fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000
}
 
or using upstream syntax

location ~ *.php {
 fastcgi_pass php
}
