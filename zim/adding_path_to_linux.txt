====== adding path to linux ======
Created Monday 15 July 2013

You can type above command at the terminal or add it to your .bashrc (for BASH/sh shell) or .cshrc (for chs / tcsh shell) so that PATH can be set each time you login into box. For example add /usr/local/bin to your path under BASH, enter:

**#export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin**

Or add as follows to your .bashrc file:
**#echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc**

If you are using CSH / TCSH, enter:
**#echo 'set PATH = ($PATH /usr/local/bin /scripts/admin)' >> ~/.cshrc**

To display path settings, enter:
**$ echo $PATH**
