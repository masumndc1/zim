9.2.3.1. Parameters & usage
The SFQ is pretty much self tuning:
perturb 
Reconfigure hashing once this many seconds. If unset, hash will never be reconfigured. Not
recommended. 10 seconds is probably a good value.
quantum
Amount of bytes a stream is allowed to dequeue before the next queue gets a turn. Defaults to 1
maximum sized packet (MTU-sized). Do not set below the MTU!
limit
The total number of packets that will be queued by this SFQ (after that it starts dropping them).
9.2.3.2. Sample configuration

If you have a device which has identical link speed and actual available rate, like a phone modem, this
configuration will help promote fairness:
# tc qdisc add dev ppp0 root sfq perturb 10
# tc -s -d qdisc ls

qdisc sfq 800c: dev ppp0 quantum 1514b limit 128p flows 128/1024 perturb 10sec
Sent 4812 bytes 62 pkts (dropped 0, overlimits 0)
The number 800c: is the automatically assigned handle number, limit means that 128 packets can wait in
this queue. There are 1024 hashbuckets available for accounting, of which 128 can be active at a time (no
more packets fit in the queue!) Once every 10 seconds, the hashes are reconfigured.
