########################## allowing icmp traffic through asa

1. create object group

object-group icmp-type icmp-traffic
 icmp-object echo
 icmp-object echo-reply
 icmp-object time-exceeded
 icmp-object traceroute
 icmp-object unreachable
ciscoasa(config)# 

2. create access-list and refence the created object-group in it.

ciscoasa(config)# show run access-list 
access-list www-allow extended permit tcp any host 10.10.10.10 eq www 
access-list www-allow extended permit tcp host 10.10.10.1 host 10.10.10.10 eq 2222 
access-list www-allow extended permit tcp host 10.10.10.1 host 10.10.10.10 eq ssh 
access-list www-allow extended permit icmp any any object-group icmp-traffic 
access-list www-allow extended permit udp any any eq domain 
ciscoasa(config)# 

# the last line which indicates the domain is for dns resulation.
# other wise dmz1 was able to ping 4.2.2.1 but not www.facebook.com
# as we hav set up 4.2.2.1 for nameserver so we enable domain name
# resulation by the last line.

3. create access-group

access-group icmp-allow in interface outside

# this is the tricky part here. as we know that asa will prevent traffic going 
# from lower security-level toward higher security level. 
# as outside is security-level 0. so when icmp request is going from dmz1(sec-lev 50)
# or inside(sec 100) it will allow to go outside (sec 0) but must prevent getting in.
# therefore we cant see ping success. but actualy it happens if you see by wireshark.
# 

# so as ping is back from lower sec-level ie outside interface we need to put
# the access-group inbound at outside interface.

# the same rule is applicable for ping coming out of dmz1 toward inside(100).
# so we need to apply the following access-group

ciscoasa(config)# show run access-group 
access-group www-allow in interface dmz1
ciscoasa(config)#

# this will make icmp successful from dmz1(50) to inside(100)

4. verify

#### deny and permit the icmp toward asa

# we can do this by two possible options
# 1. by acl which controls the icmp going through itself 
#
# 2. by acl which works in control-plane referred to as control-plane
# filtering which actually used to control any types of traffic directed 
# toward itself. we have to apply an acl and apply that acl with 
# access-group. now instead of using this acl to any particular interace
# we use it with control-plane

# so we are restricting all kind of icmp coming at the interface outsite.

ciscoasa(config)# icmp ?

  deny         Specify packets to reject

  Hostname or A.B.C.D  Hostname or IP address of the host sending ICMP messages

  any                  Any ip address and mask
