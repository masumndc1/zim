//////////////////////// nat before 8.2


/// performing nat vs enforced nat

/// performing nat
os version 7.0 or later version allows packets
from higher security interface to travel to lower
security interface which is performing nat.

asa by default nat enabled. on the other hand

/// enforcing nat
enforcing nat means we have to configure nat for all
of the packets going toward lower security interface
that means outbound interface. before os version 7.0
we had to do that. 

enforcing nat is a kind of security enhancement. no 
outbound traffic is allowed if no rules are applied 
and packets are dropped.

and we can force asa to use enforce nat by the following

asa(config)# nat-control



//// nat exemption

therefore if we dont need nat we can stop by not enabling
nat-control. nat will be applied on packets whose rules
are there on configuration. other packets will not be touched.

there are other scenario where nat is not applied

a. if there is needed any kind of end-to-end encryption. 
decryption failes on the other hand.

b. if we need to encrypt the entire packets ie authetication
header (AH) or border gateway protocol (BGP). if encryption
occurs before translation of IP/PORT then packet drops at other
end when it tries to decrypt the packet.

c. if we need additional dynamic sessions to be build and ASA
fails to inspect the content of the packets after NAT/PAT then we
should not use NAT/PAT.	

d. we should not also use nat/pat in case of vpn and internal 
communication like internal interface to dmz. in later case
we can use dynamic routing like ospf/eigrp because communication
between private does not need natting though it can be done.


/// dynamic inside nat

the basic two commands to do dynamic inside nat is like below.

asa(config)# global (outside) 1 209.165.200.235-209.165.200.254 netmask 255.255.255.224 timeout xlate 1:00:00
asa(config)# nat (inside) 1 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0

global
the key word for natting pool 

outside 
means outside interface

1
a nat id 

ip range with subnet mask

timeout xlate 1:00:00
timeout value for translation

nat 
keyword 

inside
inside interface from where the ips will be natted.

1
again the nat id which match the previous nat id to be used.
inside ips will use this nat id. 

there can be multiple nat id
and we have flexibility to configure which nat id to use.

ip range and subnet mask
these ips will be natted to global pool.

note below of another configuration..

asa(config)# global (outside) 1 209.165.200.235-209.165.200.254 netmask 255.255.255.224 timeout xlate 1:00:00
asa(config)# nat (inside) 1 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0
asa(config)# global (outside) 2 202.4.191.1-202.4.191.10 netmask 255.255.255.240 timeout xlate 1:00:00
asa(config)# nat (inside) 2 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0

here inside two range ips are using two different pool when to communicate outside. we can do that.
asa is flexible to do so.



//// dynamic inside pat


 asa(config)# global (outside) 5 interface
 asa(config)# nat (inside) 5 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 tcp 0 0 udp 0

 asa(config)# global (DMZ) 5 172.16.0.254 netmask 255.255.255.255
 asa(config)# nat (DMZ) 5 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.0 tcp 0 0 udp 0

natted to outside interface ( no matter what will be the ips of that interface).
in that case port will be used for as the single ip of outside interface.

next two lines are also same type. direct interface ip is use instead of 
key word interface. here dmz's 172.16.0.0/24 will be natted to 172.16.0.254 with
different outgoing ports.
