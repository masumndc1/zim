startup-config: asa puts its starup-config with no name in a hidden
partion of flash memory.



#################### startup config file ########################



we can change the startup config file to be used in next boot time
with the command "boot config <url>" where url is the pointing location
where to find the new statup config file. 

as soon as we issue the above said command asa is to be said to use
the new location file. 

moreover any new command like "copy running-config startup-config" will
write the current running config to the new file say newconfig in new location.
the rule is if the file is already exist then it will merge the content to
it. if not exits asa will create the file. also asa will change the 
environmental parameters to use this new file from then next reboot.

therefore it is always safe to store current running config before.

asa(config)# boot config ?

configure mode commands/options:
  flash:  Path and filename on flash:
asa(config)# boot config 

"show bootvar" is used to see the current environment variable
which indicates the current location of startup-config along
with other parameters.

asa(config)# show bootvar 

BOOT variable = 
Current BOOT variable = 
CONFIG_FILE variable = 
Current CONFIG_FILE variable = 
asa(config)#
