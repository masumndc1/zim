file : /etc/network/interfaces

formate 

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

... or ...

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 
	netmask
	gateway
	broadcast 
	dns-nameservers 4.2.2.1 4.2.2.2
	network
	
	
.. also when the interface getting ip netmask default gateway from 
.. dhcp server we can control what it will get by following.

root@deb-7:/etc/dhcp# cat -n dhclient.conf
     1	# Configuration file for /sbin/dhclient, which is included in Debian's
     2	#	dhcp3-client package.
     3	#
     4	# This is a sample configuration file for dhclient. See dhclient.conf's
     5	#	man page for more information about the syntax of this file
     6	#	and a more comprehensive list of the parameters understood by
     7	#	dhclient.
     8	#
     9	# Normally, if the DHCP server provides reasonable information and does
    10	#	not leave anything out (like the domain name, for example), then
    11	#	few changes must be made to this file, if any.
    12	#
    13	
    14	option rfc3442-classless-static-routes code 121 = array of unsigned integer 8;
    15	
    16	#send host-name "andare.fugue.com";
    17	send host-name = gethostname();
    18	#send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
    19	#send dhcp-lease-time 3600;
    20	#supersede domain-name "fugue.com home.vix.com";
    21	#prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

.. the following two lines were important for me

    22	prepend domain-name-servers 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2;
    23	request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
    24		domain-name, domain-search, host-name,
    25		dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,
    26		netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
    27		rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;

.. here i have commented out the domain-name-server portion from the request 

root@deb-7:/etc/dhcp# 

root@deb-7:/etc/dhcp# cat /etc/resolv.conf 
domain localdomain
search localdomain
nameserver 4.2.2.1
nameserver 4.2.2.2
root@deb-7:/etc/dhcp#
