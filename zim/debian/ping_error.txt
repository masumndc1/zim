... when we have following error

root@controller:~/puppet/manifests# ping yahoo.com
ping: yahoo.com: Name or service not known
root@controller:~/puppet/manifests#

... then we have to remove the following line in /etc/nsswitch.conf file

**[NOTFOUND=return]**

... and /etc/nsswitch.conf should look like following. 
hosts:	file dns

... the reason of rejecting host dns mapping is when its first nameserver
... in /etc/resolv.conf gives error it then ignore all further lookup.
... therefore we have to change the nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf and
... the restart the networking.
