**Please note that if you get an error su: Sorry for normal user account. Following workaround needed to get rid of this problem/error:**

**1) For security, reason FreeBSD only allows su to root user, if user is member of wheel group. Wheel group is a special group for administration purpose. Add your normal user to this group using pw command using following:**
**# pw user mod username -G wheel**

**2) So to add user vivek to group wheel run command as follows:**
**# pw user mod vivek -G wheel**
**# groups vivek**
