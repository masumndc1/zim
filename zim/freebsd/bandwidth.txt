.. the traffic shaping system used in openbsd is ALTQ or alternate traffic queue.

.. queue concept.
.. queue is the buffer for the network packets. in other way holding place for the 
.. network packets. this queue holds packet untill either they dropped or send to 
.. specific destination. queue is attached to interface and the bandwidth to inter
.. face then subdivided. 

.. these queue can be allocated with bandwidth. some queue are served with priority
.. that means these queues will be processed with shorter delay before other. these
.. queues can be sub child of the other queues. some queues are combination of 
.. bandwidth and the priority.

.. with no altq place, tcp/ip stack processes the packet as they appears like fifo
.. first in first out ie in order. there are three queue schedular algorithms. they
.. are priq, cbq and hfsc.

.. priq
.. the priority based queue gives the preference over other queue based on number
.. starting from 0 to 15. the higher is better.

.. cbq 
.. cbq is the fixed based queue management where measurement is done on available
.. bandwidth in kilobit,megabit,gigabit wise. the queues in cbq can be also 
.. subqueues with priority from 0 to 7. same as priq, cbq of higher priority will
.. served first than queue with lower priority.

.. hfsc 
.. hierarchical fair service curve, ensures the fair allocation of bandwith among
.. the queues. as it has tunable parameters but most altq practioners like to 
.. keep them simple. it has also priority number 0 to 7.

.. setting up the priority based priq queue.

.. priority queue has the following format

-bash-4.3# man 5 pf.conf

.. we can find the all options related to pf.conf in openbsd6

altq on interface type [options ... ] main_queue { sub_q1, sub_q2 ..}
  queue sub_q1 [ options ... ]
  queue sub_q2 [ options ... ]
[...]
pass [ ... ] queue sub_q1
pass [ ... ] queue sub_q2

.. courtesy: https://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/altqintro.html

.. and one sample queue configuraiton like below. match the sample 
.. with the format.

ext_if="kue0"

altq on $ext_if priq bandwidth 100Kb queue { q_pri, q_def }
	queue q_pri priority 7
	queue q_def priority 1 priq(default)

pass out on $ext_if proto tcp from $ext_if queue (q_def, q_pri)
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $ext_if queue (q_def, q_pri)

.. my pf.conf file has the following configuration regarding the queueing 
.. concept as well as priority value.

    35	#pass in on $ext_if inet proto icmp from any to ($ext_if) icmp-type { unreach, redir, timex }

.. our main concern is below here we have enabled the priority queue priq
.. and set up the bandwidth 100Kb with two subqueue q_pri, q_def with
.. priority 7 and priority 1 respectively and last one is our default 
.. priority. ordering is important here.

    37	###### queueing 
    38	altq on $ext_if priq bandwidth 100Kb queue { q_pri, q_def }
    39	queue q_pri priority 7
    40	queue q_def priority 1 priq(default)

    46	udp_services = "{ domain }"
    47	tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, https, pop3s }"

    48	table <webserver> persist { 192.168.244.132, 192.168.244.147 }

.. our nat and the redirect rules are like that

    50	nat on $ext_if inet from $int_if:network -> ($ext_if)
    51	rdr pass on $ext_if proto tcp to port { www, https } -> <webserver> 

..

    52	block all
    53	pass log (all) proto tcp to port $tcp_services

.. placing the queue with a pass rule. when any ssh traffic incoming to
.. ext_if interface em0 it will go through the queue previously defined
.. q_def and q_pri. 

    54	pass on $ext_if proto tcp to ($ext_if) port ssh queue (q_def, q_pri)
    55	pass log (all) proto udp to port $udp_services

.... class based queueing, cbq ....

.. my configuration regarding cbq on pf.conf is follows.

###### cbq
altq on $ext_if cbq bandwidth 5Mb queue { mainq, webq, udpq, sshq, icmpq }
queue mainq bandwidth 18% cbq(default borrow red)
queue udpq bandwidth 30% cbq(borrow red)
queue webq bandwidth 20% cbq(borrow red)
queue sshq bandwidth 20% cbq(borrow red) { ssh_interactive, ssh_bulk }
       queue ssh_interactive priority 7 bandwidth 20%
       queue ssh_bulk priority 0 bandwidth 80%
queue icmpq bandwidth 2% cbq

.. and pass rules regarding cbq are belows.

icmp_services = "{ icmp }"
udp_services = "{ domain }"
tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, https, pop3s }"

pass log (all) proto tcp to port $tcp_services queue mainq 
pass log (all) proto tcp to port { www, https } $tcp_services queue webq
pass on $ext_if proto tcp to ($ext_if) port ssh queue (ssh_bulk, ssh_interactive)
pass log (all) proto udp to port $udp_services queue udpq
pass log (all) proto icmp queue icmpq

.. but my cbq rules have failed with following error
.. on web people suggesting following for the remedy.

ALTQ : pfctl: DIOCADDALTQ: Cannot allocate memory 

.. on the following files or any altq.c file found

/usr/include/altq/altq_hfsc.h
/usr/src/sbin/pfctl/missing/altq/altq_hfsc.h
/usr/src/sys/contrib/altq/altq/altq_hfsc.h

.. put the following 1024 line instead of 64 line.

#define HFSC_MAX_CLASSES 1024 
#define HFSC_MAX_CLASSES 64 

then recompile kernel.

.... hfsc based traffic shaping.
