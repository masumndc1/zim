20 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
-bash-4.3# 

.. to see packets only related to ssh 

-bash-4.3# tcpdump -n -ttt -i pflog0 port ssh


.... logging send to another machine over the network

.. first we have to disable the pf loggin to local machine like below.

-bash-4.3# cat -n rc.local.conf | grep -i pf  

    48  pflogd_flags="-f /dev/null"             # add more flags, e.g. "-s 256"
    90  pf=YES                  # Packet filter / NAT

-bash-4.3# 

.. in freebsd we do that like below

root@masum:/etc # cat -n rc.conf | grep -i pf
    11	pf_enable="YES"
    15	pflog_logfile="/dev/null"
root@masum:/etc # 

.. now we change the setting in syslog.conf file to instruct our remote
.. syslog server

-bash-4.3# cat -n syslog.conf | grep -i local2
    40  local2.info                                                     @192.168.244.147
-bash-4.3# 

.. and restart the syslog daemon

-bash-4.3# /etc/rc.d/syslogd status
usage: /etc/rc.d/syslogd [-df] start|stop|restart|reload|check
-bash-4.3# /etc/rc.d/syslogd restart
syslogd(ok)
syslogd(ok)
-bash-4.3# 

.. and finally reload the pf 

-bash-4.3# pf -d
-bash-4.3# pf -evf /etc/pf.conf

.. and convert the binary file format of the pflog file with the tcpdump 
.. and logger option and send it to the syslog daemon.

-bash-4.3# nohup tcpdump -lnettti pflog0 | logger -t pf -p local2.info &

.. and it now will send all the pf related log to the syslog server.
.. our syslog server is as follows

... netflow.

.. netflow allows us to collect the data travers unidirectional direction in connection.
.. pf allow to netflow with the special interfac pflow. it works like as it send the 
.. data to the collector which then stores and illustrated for the view.
.. to activate the netflow data we need a pass rule with pflow key. 

.. if we want to send netflow data from 192.168.244.10 to be send to collector 192.168.244.1
.. on udp port 3301 we do that like below.

.. 192.168.244.10 --> 192.168.244.1:3301 (collector)

-bash-4.3# ifconfig pflow0 create flowsrc 192.168.244.10 flowdst 192.168.244.1:3301
-bash-4.3# 
-bash-4.3# ifconfig pflow0
pflow0: flags=41<UP,RUNNING> mtu 1492
        index 8 priority 0 llprio 3
        pflow: sender: 192.168.244.10 receiver: 192.168.244.1:3301 version: 5
        groups: pflow
-bash-4.3# 

.. or can place in a file /etc/hostname.pflow0 below

flowsrc 192.168.244.10 flowdst 192.168.244.1:3301

.. then we place following in /etc/pf.conf with (pflow) key word.

pass log (all) proto icmp label "icmp" keep state (pflow)

.. The OpenBSD packages system offers three NetFlow collector and
.. analysis packages: flow-tools , flowd , and nfdump .

.. we are using flowd
