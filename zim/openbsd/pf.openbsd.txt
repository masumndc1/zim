....................... packet filtering pf ..............................

.. to disable pf we do like below
.. openbsd

bash-4.3# pfctl -d
pf disabled
bash-4.3# 

.. enable it like below

bash-4.3# pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf 
pf enabled
bash-4.3# 

bash-4.3# pfctl -e 
pf enabled
bash-4.3# 


.. freebsd
 
root@masum:~ # pfctl -d
pfctl: pf not enabled
root@masum:~ # 

.. we enable it like below.

root@masum:~ # pfctl -e
pf enabled
root@masum:~ # 

.. if we like to run the pflog then we do that like below


root@masum:~ # cat -n /etc/rc.conf

      pflogd_flags=""         # add more flags, e.g. "-s 256"

root@masum:~ # 
   
.. simple configuraiton rule of pf
 
root@masum:~ # vi /etc/pf.conf

set skip on lo

block in all

.. the above line saying block all the traffinc incoming to the pf
.. pf reads the rules from top to bottom. the last line applied 
.. which match the rule set.

pass out all keep state

.. the above rule say to keep state all the outgoing traffic. outgoing
.. traffic is allowed.

#block return    # block stateless traffic
#pass            # establish keep-state

# By default, do not permit remote connections to X11
block return in on ! lo0 proto tcp to port 6000:6010

.. on this point every new incoming traffic will be rejected but
.. exiting connection will be enabled as we said keep state. 
.. openbsd will keep track of the connection. it will keep active
.. any new packet which matches the existing connection.

.. now we will just allow 22 80 443 port service like below.

-bash-4.3# cat /etc/pf.conf 

set skip on lo

block in all
pass proto tcp to port { 22 80 443 }
pass out all keep state

#block return   # block stateless traffic
#pass           # establish keep-state

# By default, do not permit remote connections to X11
block return in on ! lo0 proto tcp to port 6000:6010
-bash-4.3# 

-bash-4.3# cat /etc/pf.conf 

block in all
pass proto tcp to port 22
pass proto icmp 
pass out all keep state

root@masum:~ # 

.. we are using macro here. we could also use like below using the
.. macro/variable.

root@masum:~ # vi /etc/pf.conf

# See pf.conf(5) and /etc/examples/pf.conf

set skip on lo

icmp_services = "{ icmp }"
udp_services = "{ domain }"
tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, https, pop3s }"

.. these services can be found from /etc/services file

block all

.. in bsd OS rules order is important. say if we place block all in 
.. last line in our pf.conf file then all the service will be locked 
.. down as we know the pf rules are checked from top to bottom.
..
.. therefore we need to place it at top of starting of our rules set.
.. like here.

pass proto tcp to port $tcp_services
pass proto udp to port $udp_services
pass proto $icmp_services

pass out all keep state

#block return   # block stateless traffic
#pass           # establish keep-state

# By default, do not permit remote connections to X11

.. now restart it like below.

-bash-4.3# pfctl -vf /etc/pf.conf 
set skip on { lo }
icmp_services = "{ icmp }"
udp_services = "{ domain }"
tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, https, pop3s }"
block drop all
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 22 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 25 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 53 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 80 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 110 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 113 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 443 flags S/SA
pass proto tcp from any to any port = 995 flags S/SA
pass proto udp from any to any port = 53
pass proto icmp all
pass out all flags S/SA
block return in on ! lo0 proto tcp from any to any port 6000:6010

-bash-4.3# 

.. checking our rules without loading for the error. -F will flush 
.. all the rules. flushing rules is good as it will permit all
.. traffic and it will be used to test the connectivity.
