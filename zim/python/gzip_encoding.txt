... when we want server will send us a specific encoding as response 
... say, gzip encoding we do that as following.

>>> 
>>> from urllib.request import urlopen
>>> from urllib.request import Request
>>> 
>>> 
>>> req=Request('http://www.debian.org')
>>> req.add_header('Accept-Encoding', 'gzip')

... adding gzip to request server to send us the response in gzip compressed.

>>> response=urlopen(req)

... in the response the content encoding we have gzip as we have expected
... which can be verified by the following command.

>>> response.getheader('Content-encoding')
'gzip'
>>> 

... as the response, we got is compressed with the gzip therefore we have to 
... decompres it with gzip decompress utility like below.

>>> import gzip
>>> content = gzip.decompress(response.read())
>>> 
>>> content.splitlines()[:5]
 [b'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">',

... Encodings are gzip , compress ,deflate , and identity . 
... The identity says the client does not want any specific encoding applied.
