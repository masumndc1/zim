... Installing MySQL
... 
... In this section, we will install and configure MySQL.

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

... The MySQL server will start once installation completes. After installation, run:

    mysql_secure_installation

... Python 3 requires a way to connect with MySQL, however. There are a number of options, 
... like MySQLclient, but for the module's simplicity, this tutorial will use pymysql. Install it using Pip:

    pip3 install pymysql
