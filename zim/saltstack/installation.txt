... location of the master server and the minion.

... clients in salt are called minions. these minion try
... to connect with master. master is another host which can push
... configuration in minions.

[root@salt ~]# cd /etc/salt
[root@salt salt]# ls
master  minion
[root@salt salt]#
[root@salt salt]# vi minion

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
# master: salt
master: localhost

... when a minion first time starts it tries to connect with master. master
... is specified with a name mensioned in /etc/hosts or DNS entry. in this 
... example as we dont have any host specified with the name salt, we are
... taking localhost as our master.

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
#id:
id: myminion

... above is specified in minion file regarding to minion defination.
... we can run multiple minions on the same machine but with the different
... minion ids. we are going to set up one minion id.

... now restart both salt-master and salt-minion
