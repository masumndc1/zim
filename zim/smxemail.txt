Dear I am answeing your question step by step.

Q.    Can you tell me the difference between Postfix and Sendmail?

ans: 
Though both of them are mail transfer agent(MTA),
Postfix uses a modular approach and is composed of multiple independent executables.that is modular. 
Sendmail has a more monolithic design utilizing a single always running daemon.
Postfix is newer than sendmail.


Q.    Do you run your own mail or web server? If, yes describe the setup. 
    If you do not run your own, describe why you prefer not to do this (or alternatively: how you would do this).

ans:
I never used my own mail as well as web server. however I know how to configure mail and webserver. 
first i have to buy one domain name. they will give me a cpanel where i will point my dns server
which will point my mail and webserver pointing to public ip address.I then configure mail and
webserver on pointing public server. I prefer linux, either centos or debian.

for the full procedure of setup of mail and webserver plz see the attached documents how i configured 
mail and webserver.

for mail server setup plz refer to mail.html file. open it in web browser once i learned html and css3
that time i created this html file for documentations.

Q.    Why is DNS important for email delivery? Explain which records are important.

ans:
for this answer please see the dns.txt file as attached.

Q.    Which software would you use for backing up a Linux server. Which directories would you back up

ans: i prefer tar to backup linux server. i would like to backup the /var as well as /home directory.
as these directories contains webserver index file as well as mail server's stored mail depending
on setup.

and for the process plz refer to the tar.txt file attached.
