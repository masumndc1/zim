//The ip link command shows the network device's configurations that can be
//changed with ip link set. This command is used to modify the device's proprieties
//and not the IP address.

//The IP addresses can be configured using the ip addr command. This command can
//be used to add a primary or secondary (alias) IP address to a network device (ip
addr add), to display the IP addresses for each network device (ip addr show), or to
delete IP addresses from interfaces (ip addr del). IP addresses can also be flushed
using different criteria, e.g. ip addr flush dynamic will flush all routes added to the
kernel by a dynamic routing protocol.

ip tunnel is used to manage tunneled connections. Tunnels can be gre, ipip, and
sit. We will include an example later in the book on how to build IP tunnels.
