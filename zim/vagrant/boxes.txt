... vagrant manages the boxes in 

$ ls -a .vagran*
.vagrant:
.  ..  machines

$ .vagrant.d:
.  ..  boxes  data  gems  insecure_private_key  rgloader  setup_version  tmp

.... adding boxes to vagrant.

... we can download boxes from web and add them manually to vagrant like below.

$ vagrant box add --name freebsd8.4 FreeBSD-8.4-i386.box 
==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
==> box: Adding box 'freebsd8.4' (v0) for provider: 
    box: Unpacking necessary files from: file:///media/masum/KAJ_KAM/FreeBSD-8.4-i386.box
==> box: Successfully added box 'freebsd8.4' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!

...  therefore after adding we have following boxes

$ vagrant box list
freebsd8.4      (virtualbox, 0)
ubuntu/trusty32 (virtualbox, 20170602.0.0)

... now run the following command to run it

$ vagrant up freebsd8.4
A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
Vagrantfile and to try again.

A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
