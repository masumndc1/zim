... shared folder between vagrant and host machine

... following is the mapping of shared folder
... /vagrant directory in vagrant box is mapped to 
... host machine's $HOME.

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/$ ls
bin   dev  home        lib         media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr      var
boot  etc  initrd.img  lost+found  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  vagrant  vmlinuz
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/$ cd vagrant/
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ ls
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ ls Vagrantfile 
Vagrantfile
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ 

... therefore i can edit any file in any machine which 
... will effect on both in shared folder.

... i have the following setting in my Vagrantfile. it is saying
... the guest machine's /home/masum/vagrantfile and its content will be accessible
... to vagrant guest machines /vagrant. we can edit delete or create
... file and folders here.

  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/masum/vagrantfile", "/vagrant"

... this is inside the vagrant machine

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:~$ cd /vagrant/
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ ls
Vagrantfile
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ touch masum.txt
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ ls
masum.txt  Vagrantfile
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:/vagrant$ 

... this is inside the host machine.
