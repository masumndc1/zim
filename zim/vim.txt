====== vim ======
Created Sunday 10 November 2013

A. Vim or vi is a text editor. It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text. It is especially useful for editing programs or UNIX/Linux configuration files.
Task: Turn on color syntax highlighting

Open file (for example file.c):
$ vi file.c

Now press ESC key, type : syntax on
:syntax on
Task: Turn off color syntax highlighting

To turn it back off, press ESC key, type : syntax off
:syntax off

You can edit ~/.vimrc file and add command syntax on to it so that next you will start vim with color syntax highlighting option
$ cd
$ vi .vimrc
Append the following line:
syntax on

    @ Bobby, while it may work, I’m guessing you have an extra command after typing vim filename, that is because it’s asking for extra info…and can be avoided by hitting enter the correct way is:

    set ts=4
    set sw=4
    set spell
    set spl=en
    syntax on
    set wrap
    set ai

    etc….
