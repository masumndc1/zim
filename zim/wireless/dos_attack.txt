... the attack we are demonstrating here is de auth attack
... which is the disconnecting the client from the ap so
... that the client connects back with the ap again and 
... complete the 4way handshake again.

... rougue access point creation with the same name (essid) to confuse the clients
... to connect again is another type of man-in-the-middle attack in wireless network.
... we are using airbase-ng for that.

... after creating the rougue access-point we can deauth all the associated
... client to disconnect and connect back to our accesspoint.

... another way to lure the clients to add one rougue interface created in the
... attacker laptop. say attacker has one lan port through which he is using inter
... net. therefore when victim connects to this rougue interface will try to use
... interface. attacker provide his internet access so that victim never
... notice that he is using any unsolicited network.

1. create any rougue ap using any suitable name using airbase-ng command 
2. create one bridge-interface and add interface to it.

 # brctl addbr masum-wifi-bridge
 # brctl addif masum-wifi-bridge eth0
 # brctl addif masum-wifi-bridge at0

3. bring the both interface up.

 # ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
 # ifconfig at0 0.0.0.0 up

4. enable port forwarding

 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

... if there is a dhcp server running in the lan or in laptop can get the ip
...
